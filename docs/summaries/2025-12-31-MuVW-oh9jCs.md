# [2025年頻道回顧：誰是我的流量密碼？年度觀看數 TOP 10 大公開！]

## 重點摘要
這支影片回顧了頻道在2025年（扣除國際賽）觀看數最高的十支影片。總結發現，戰績差勁的富邦悍將是最大的「流量怪物」，為頻道貢獻了最多的觀看次數，而許多高流量影片都源自於意想不到的突發事件或真實生活經歷。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片主（架屬）決定回顧2025年自己頻道上觀看數最多的影片。他先排除了流量本來就高的國際賽相關內容，並從第30名開始倒數，提到一些遺珠之憾，如樂天桃猿的宿舍風波、總教練撤換事件，以及花費10年大合約的將軍等影片都未能進入前20名。
- **中段**：影片接著公佈11到20名，其中富邦Angels韓籍成員李晧禎（이호정）相關的影片佔了三支，顯示她在季初的超高人氣。接著，影片主逐一揭曉前10名，並分享每支影片背後的故事，例如：與洋基總教練的巧遇、花費17萬標下開球權、在美國海關遇到認識曾紀恩的官員、批評媒體「頂樓」製造假新聞引發球迷共鳴，以及樂天高層親自登門拜訪的「臭酸事件」後續。
- **結尾**：第一名的影片是關於富邦悍將上半季戰績崩盤的內容，但影片主坦言已記不清影片細節。最後他總結，富邦悍將是頻道最大的流量貢獻者（前25名佔了11支），並開玩笑說「富邦養活了全台灣的棒球YouTuber」，證明了戰績不佳的球隊反而能引發更高的討論度。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **負面聲量 > 正面聲量**：戰績差、充滿爭議的球隊（如富邦悍將）比戰績好的球隊更能引發社群討論和關注，成為內容創作者的「流量密碼」。
2.  **真實性勝過企劃**：許多高觀看的影片來自無法預期的真實事件，如「美國海關奇遇」或「樂天高層拜訪」，這些內容比精心企劃的影片更能吸引觀眾。
3.  **啦啦隊的影響力**：高人氣的啦啦隊成員（如李晧禎）能在短時間內帶來巨大的流量，只要影片標題或內容與其相關，幾乎就是觀看保證。
4.  **社群共鳴的力量**：針對球迷普遍不滿的議題（如批評特定媒體的假新聞）製作內容，能有效引發廣大迴響，創造高觀看數。
5.  **高成本不等於高觀看**：花費17萬台幣的開球企劃雖然成功，但其觀看數不如預期；反而是一些沒有腳本、隨手記錄的口述影片衝上排行榜前段。

## 精彩時刻
- 在美國海關，一位官員竟認識台灣的棒球教練「曾紀恩」（Tseng Chi-feng），並與影片主聊了起來，這個神奇經歷讓一支簡單的口述影片爆紅。
- 因「臭酸事件」被樂天球團誤會後，樂天高層竟然親自跑到他台南的家登門拜訪，成為另一個「流量直接塞到臉上」的事件。
- 影片主自認有社交障礙，為了拍片去各超商詢問有沒有富邦iCash卡，讓他拍完後一個禮拜不想跟人說話。
- 他在影片最後直言：「富邦雖然戰績墊底，但是他們真的是中職的流量怪物。」

# [2025 Channel Recap: Who Was My Traffic Goldmine? Top 10 Most-Viewed Videos Revealed!]

## TL;DR
This video reviews the channel's top ten most-viewed videos of 2025 (excluding international games). The main takeaway is that the Fubon Guardians, despite their poor performance, were the biggest "traffic monster," driving the most views. Additionally, many viral hits came from unexpected, real-life events rather than planned content.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The creator ("Jia Shu") decides to review his most-watched videos of 2025. He first excludes international game analysis, which naturally draws high traffic. He starts the countdown from #30, mentioning some notable videos that didn't even make the top 20, like the Rakuten Monkeys' dorm controversy and the firing of their manager.
- **Middle**: He moves on to ranks 11-20, noting that three videos featured Lee Choo-hyoen of the Fubon Angels, highlighting her immense popularity at the start of the season. He then reveals the top 10 one by one, sharing the backstory for each. Highlights include a chance encounter with the Yankees' manager, spending 170,000 TWD to throw a ceremonial first pitch, meeting a US customs officer who knew of a legendary Taiwanese manager, a video criticizing a media outlet for fake news that resonated with fans, and the follow-up to the "sour smell incident" where Rakuten's management personally visited his home.
- **End**: The #1 video was about the Fubon Guardians' mid-season collapse, though the creator admits he barely remembers what he said in it. He concludes by analyzing which team contributed the most traffic: Fubon was the undisputed king (11 of the top 25 videos). He jokes that "Fubon supports all of Taiwan's baseball YouTubers," proving that a poorly performing team can generate far more discussion than a successful one.

## Key Insights
1.  **Negative Buzz > Positive Buzz**: A losing, controversial team (like the Fubon Guardians) generates more community discussion and attention than a winning one, becoming a "traffic goldmine" for creators.
2.  **Authenticity Trumps Production**: Many of the highest-ranking videos stemmed from unscripted, real-life events, like the "US Customs encounter" or the "Rakuten management visit," which proved more engaging than heavily planned content.
3.  **The Cheerleader Effect**: A popular cheerleader (like Lee Choo-hyoen) can provide a massive, immediate traffic boost. Content related to them, even tangentially, is almost a guaranteed hit.
4.  **The Power of Community Resonance**: Creating content that addresses widespread fan frustrations (e.g., criticizing a specific media outlet for fake news) is highly effective at generating views and engagement.
5.  **High Cost Doesn't Equal High Views**: The video project for the first pitch, which cost 170,000 TWD (~$5,500 USD), didn't perform as well as expected. In contrast, simple, unscripted vlogs shot on the fly became some of the year's biggest hits.

## Notable Moments
- At US customs, an officer recognized the name of legendary Taiwanese baseball manager Tseng Chi-feng and struck up a conversation, a bizarre experience that made a simple talking-head video go viral.
- After being misunderstood by the Rakuten Monkeys team in the "sour smell incident," the team's top management showed up at his home in Tainan to talk, which he described as "traffic being shoved in my face."
- The creator, who has social anxiety, described the agony of going to numerous convenience stores to ask for Fubon iCash cards for a video, which made him want to avoid human contact for a week.
- His final declaration: "Fubon may have finished last, but they are truly the CPBL's traffic monster."
