# 《如何擊敗城堡快攻「奇葩戰術」－世紀帝國2玩家對戰分析》

## 重點摘要
一名1500分的玩家在開局取得巨大優勢後，因錯誤地優先發展經濟（開三座城鎮中心）而非先生產反制單位，幾乎輸給了對手的城堡快攻「奇葩戰術」。他最終憑藉壓倒性的經濟實力艱難取勝，但影片的核心教訓是：面對「all-in」猛攻時，必須優先建立防禦和反制單位，而不是貪圖經濟發展。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 玩家Holdfast（使用Wewa文明）完美地防禦了對手（西班牙）的早期資源騷擾，甚至擊殺了對方的斥侯，取得了夢幻般的開局。他隨後發動了封建時代的猛攻，成功壓制了對手。
- **中段：** 對手選擇龜縮防守，快速升上城堡時代，並開始爆兵征服者，這是一種「all-in」的奇葩戰術。此時Holdfast犯下關鍵失誤：他沒有優先研發科技（如彈道學）或生產反制單位（如茅兵），反而連續蓋了第二和第三座城鎮中心，試圖爆發經濟。這讓對手的征服者部隊滾起雪球，摧毀了Holdfast的軍隊，並對其經濟造成了毀滅性打擊。
- **結尾：** 儘管軍隊全滅、經濟混亂，Holdfast憑藉著長期以來多出對手一倍的村民數量，終於開始大量生產正確的反制單位（茅兵）。經過一場漫長而艱苦的戰鬥，他利用卓越的經濟潛力最終「淹沒」了對手，贏得了比賽，但過程遠比應有的要艱辛。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **對抗All-in的鐵則：** 當對手採取一次性猛攻時，必須優先建立軍事反制力量並穩住陣腳，**然後**才考慮擴張經濟。在安全之前，不要貪圖蓋新的城鎮中心。
2.  **經濟優勢的真相：** 如果你的村民 постоянно被攻擊而無法有效工作，那麼村民數量再多也沒用。一個規模較小但穩定的經濟，遠勝於一個規模龐大但混亂不堪的經濟。
3.  **關鍵科技的重要性：** 彈道學（Ballistics）對於打擊像征服者這樣的高機動性單位至關重要，應該儘早研發。
4.  **避免劣勢戰鬥：** 當你擁有經濟優勢時，時間就是你最好的朋友。撤退、集結正確的單位，讓你的優勢慢慢發酵，遠比衝動地打一場沒有把握的仗要好。
5.  **一個錯誤決策的代價：** 即使開局大優，一個錯誤的戰略決策（例如，在危險時爆經濟而非防守）就足以讓你幾乎輸掉整場比賽。

## 精彩時刻
- **完美的開局防守：** 影片一開始，Holdfast巧妙地應對騷擾，反殺了對手的斥侯，讓旁述者大加讚賞。
- **令人扼腕的決策：** 旁述者看到Holdfast在敵人大軍壓境時，竟然還在蓋第三座城鎮中心時，不禁驚呼：「這太瘋狂了！你竟然用三城鎮中心去對抗一個單城鎮爆兵的對手！」
- **災難性的會戰：** Holdfast在劣勢下貿然開戰，軍隊瞬間蒸發，旁述者評論道：「這是一場糟透的戰鬥…我們被雪球滾死了，完全如我所料。」
- **最終的教誨：** 旁述者總結道，Holdfast贏了，但「你選了一條最艱難的路」，並詳細解釋了更簡單、更穩妥的應對方法。
- **「奇葩戰術」玩家的風度：** 對手在輸掉後遲遲不投降，旁述者笑稱：「每次都是這些玩奇葩戰術的傢伙輸不起。」

# How to Beat Fast Castle "Cheese" - An AoE2 Rec Review

## TL;DR
A 1500 ELO player, after securing a massive early lead, nearly lost to a "fast castle" Conquistador all-in strategy because he greedily expanded his economy (with 3 Town Centers) instead of building counter-units first. He eventually won through sheer economic might, but the video's core lesson is to prioritize defense and counters over booming when facing an all-in.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The player, Holdfast (as Wewa), brilliantly defends an early resource lame from his Spanish opponent, even killing the enemy scout to gain a huge advantage. He follows up with strong Feudal Age aggression, putting his opponent on the back foot.
- **Middle:** The opponent plays defensively, rushes to the Castle Age, and begins massing Conquistadors—an "all-in" cheese strategy. Holdfast makes a critical error: instead of prioritizing key technologies (like Ballistics) or building counter-units (like Skirmishers), he adds a second and then a third Town Center to boom his economy. This allows the opponent's army to "snowball," crush Holdfast's army, and wreak havoc on his economy.
- **End:** Despite taking massive damage, Holdfast's superior villager count (often double his opponent's) eventually allows him to mass-produce the correct counter-units (Skirmishers). After a long and difficult fight, he stabilizes and uses his superior economy to overwhelm the opponent, winning the game in a much harder way than necessary.

## Key Insights
1.  **The Iron Rule vs. All-Ins:** When facing an all-in attack, you must prioritize building a direct military counter and stabilizing your position **before** booming your economy. Don't add Town Centers until you are safe.
2.  **The Truth About Villager Leads:** A large villager lead is useless if your villagers are constantly being raided and cannot work efficiently. A smaller, stable economy is better than a larger, chaotic one.
3.  **The Importance of Key Tech:** Ballistics is a crucial upgrade against mobile units like Conquistadors and should be researched early.
4.  **Avoid Unfavorable Fights:** When you have an economic lead, time is on your side. It's better to fall back, mass the right units, and let your advantage grow rather than taking an impulsive, bad engagement.
5.  **The Cost of One Wrong Decision:** Even with a massive lead, a single wrong strategic decision (like booming instead of defending) can almost cost you the entire game.

## Notable Moments
- **The Perfect Opening Defense:** At the start of the video, Holdfast expertly handles the lame and kills the enemy scout, earning high praise from the narrator.
- **The Facepalm Decision:** The narrator's exasperation upon seeing Holdfast build a third TC while under threat: "This is insane. You're going 3TC against the guy who's one TC spamming..."
- **The Disastrous Engagement:** Holdfast takes a terrible fight and gets his army wiped out, prompting the narrator to say, "That was a horrible fight... We got snowballed. Exactly like I said."
- **The Final Lesson:** The narrator concludes that Holdfast won, but "you went the hard route," and then explains the much easier, safer way to have handled the situation.
- **The "Cheeser's" Salty End:** The opponent, after his cheese strategy fails, refuses to resign for a long time, with the narrator joking, "It's always these FC cheesers that get salty at the end."
