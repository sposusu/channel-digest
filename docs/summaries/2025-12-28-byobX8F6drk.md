# 【世紀帝國2】客製文明1v2對決：用史上最OP的單位粉碎對手

## 重點摘要
在《世紀帝國2》一場緊張的1v2客製文明對戰中，玩家捨棄了招牌的草原槍兵戰術，改用奇襲的「前置城堡馬穆魯克」戰術。這項出其不意的策略完全克制了對手精心準備的反制步兵文明，最終藉由疊加多種攻擊與速度加成，創造出近乎無敵的馬穆魯克單位，成功逆轉戰局。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 玩家介紹這是一場1v2的客製文明對決。他沿用上次獲勝的強力騎兵文明，該文明專精於草原槍兵。然而，他的兩位對手選擇了專門克制騎兵的超坦步兵文明（分別以「飛鏢鏢客」和「駱駝勇士」為核心），讓玩家開局就感嘆「這根本沒得打」。
- **中段：** 意識到傳統戰術會被完剋，玩家決定兵行險著。他放棄了草原槍兵，轉而利用自己文明中的隱藏王牌——馬穆魯克。他大膽地在一名對手家門口直接蓋下城堡，並開始爆兵馬穆魯克。這個奇襲策略大獲成功，迅速癱瘓了紅色對手，將戰局扭轉為更均勢的1v1。
- **結尾：** 僅存的綠色對手擁有經濟優勢和大量超坦「駱駝勇-士」。起初戰況膠著，玩家的馬穆魯克雖然機動性高，但難以正面擊潰敵軍。在關鍵時刻，玩家突然想起自己忘了研發兩個最重要的獨特科技：「馬鐙」和「法林巴」。升級完成後，他的馬穆魯克攻擊力飆升至恐怖的「10+13」，攻速也大幅提升，瞬間從玻璃大砲變成了無堅不摧的毀滅性單位，輕鬆融化了對手的所有部隊，贏得了最終勝利。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **戰術適應性的勝利：** 玩家沒有固守舊有成功模式，而是根據對手的反制策略，靈活地從草原槍兵轉換到馬穆魯克，這是致勝的關鍵。
2.  **加成疊加的恐怖力量：** 該文明結合了多種看似普通的加成（攻擊速度、雙倍近戰升級、移動速度），當全部應用在馬穆魯克身上時，創造出一個超乎想像的「怪物級」單位。
3.  **關鍵科技的決定性影響：** 戰鬥中一度陷入僵局，直到玩家研發了「馬鐙」和「法林巴」後，戰力才發生質變。這凸顯了在正確的時機點滿關鍵升級是多麼重要。
4.  **在劣勢中主動出擊：** 面對1v2的困境，玩家深知龜縮防守必敗無疑。他選擇了高風險的前置城堡戰術，成功打亂對手節奏，為自己創造了勝利的可能。
5.  **意料之外的王牌：** 對手完全預期玩家會使用草原槍兵，而馬穆魯克作為一個意想不到的選擇，成為了完美的秘密武器，徹底打了對方一個措手不及。

## 精彩時刻
- **開局的絕望：** 「我該怎麼打駱駝勇士和飛鏢鏢客？根本沒贏的機會啊。」
- **靈光一閃的時刻：** 「我想馬穆魯克作為我的獨特單位，可能是贏下這場比賽的秘密武器。」
- **初見神威的興奮：** 「（笑）馬穆魯克本來就是遊戲最強單位之一了，他們攻速更快，還有雙倍攻擊力。我已經愛上這個了。」
- **忘記升級的驚覺：** 「喔，我沒點獨特科技『馬鐙』和『法林巴』，我是白癡嗎？」
- **見證完全體單位的讚嘆：** 「這是什麼單位？這是我這輩子玩過最強的單位，沒有之一。… 微軟如果你想賣DLC，就把這個單位推出來，我保證銷量會衝破天際。」

# 1v2 Custom Civ Showdown: Smashing Opponents with the Most BROKEN Unit in History

## TL;DR
In a tense 1v2 Age of Empires II custom civilization match, the player abandoned his signature Step Lancer strategy for a surprise "forward castle Mameluke" rush. This unexpected move perfectly countered his opponents' specialized anti-cavalry infantry civs, ultimately leading to a decisive victory by creating a nearly unstoppable Mameluke unit stacked with insane attack and speed bonuses.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The player introduces the 1v2 custom civ match. He is using his winning cavalry-focused civ from the previous game, which excels with Step Lancers. However, his opponents have specifically chosen super-tanky infantry civs (one based on Chakram Throwers, the other on Kamayuks) to counter him, leading the player to exclaim, "There's no way I'm beating that."
- **Middle:** Realizing his usual strategy would be hard-countered, the player decides on a risky, creative play. He abandons Step Lancers and leans into his civ's hidden trump card: the Mameluke. He executes a bold forward castle drop right outside one opponent's base and begins massing Mamelukes. The surprise works perfectly, crippling the red player and turning the game into a more manageable 1v1.
- **End:** The remaining green opponent has a strong economy and a massive army of incredibly tanky Kamayuks. The initial fights are a stalemate, as the player's Mamelukes can kite but not decisively win. At a critical moment, the player realizes he forgot his two most important unique technologies: Stirrups and Farimba. Once researched, his Mamelukes' attack skyrockets to a terrifying "10+13" with a massive speed boost, transforming them from glass cannons into an unstoppable force that melts the enemy army and secures the win.

## Key Insights
1.  **Victory Through Adaptation:** The player won not by sticking to a proven strategy, but by pivoting from Step Lancers to Mamelukes in direct response to his opponents' counter-pick.
2.  **The Overwhelming Power of Synergy:** The civ combined several modest bonuses (faster attack, doubled melee upgrades, faster movement) that, when stacked on a single unit like the Mameluke, created a "monster" unit far greater than the sum of its parts.
3.  **The Decisive Impact of Key Upgrades:** The game was a struggle until the player researched Stirrups and Farimba. This highlights how crucial it is to get the right game-changing upgrades at the right time.
4.  **Offense is the Best Defense in a 1v2:** Facing a numbers disadvantage, the player knew a passive approach would lead to defeat. The high-risk forward castle was necessary to disrupt his opponents and create a path to victory.
5.  **The Unexpected Trump Card:** The opponents were fully prepared for Step Lancers. The Mameluke, being an entirely unexpected choice, served as the perfect secret weapon and caught them completely off guard.

## Notable Moments
- **Initial Despair:** "Ah, what do I do against camukes and freaking and freaking shakrums? There's no way I'm beating that."
- **The "Aha!" Moment:** "I think Mamaluk's being my unique unit could be the secret here to actually winning this game."
- **First Taste of Power:** "[laughter] Have you M[a]m[e]luks already one of the strongest units in the game. They're attacking faster and they have doubled attack. I I love this already."
- **The Realization:** "Oh, I didn't get [my unique] tech stir[r]ups and freaking [Farimba] what am I stupid?"
- **Awe at the Final Form:** "What is this unit? This is the best unit I've ever played with in my life. And it's not close. ... Microsoft, if you want to sell a DLC, just bring this unit out. The sales will be through the roof. I promise."
