# 世紀帝國2：Hera以一敵四的「殊死戰」模式實驗

## 重點摘要
職業選手Hera在一場新穎的「殊死戰」模式中挑戰四位玩家，此模式規定失去起始的城鎮中心即立刻戰敗。他第一局以馬來象兵的強力攻勢取勝，第二局則因戰術失誤而落敗，但他高度讚揚此模式的平衡性，認為它解決了傳統1v4對戰中經濟失衡的問題，讓比賽更加緊張刺激。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：Hera介紹了「殊死戰」(Sudden Death)這個新遊戲模式：1v4，但任何玩家只要失去唯一的城鎮中心就會被淘汰，且無法建造新的城鎮中心。他將以此規則進行兩場對戰。
- **中段**：
    - **第一局**：Hera選用馬來文明，策略是快速升級並利用強大的帝王時代單位取勝。在頂住對手們前期的聯合偵察騎兵騷擾後，他轉型出戰象，證明這對敵方的矛兵陣容是毀滅性的反制。他先用象群摧毀了紅色玩家的城鎮中心，接著用一臺投石機從地圖角落潛行，在他用主力部隊於另一側發動佯攻時，成功摧毀了藍色玩家的城鎮中心，贏得勝利。
    - **第二局**：Hera隨機選到中國，並採用快速城堡時代的火槍騎兵戰術。他利用火槍騎兵的機動性和爆發傷害在早期騷擾中取得了巨大優勢。然而，在一次對黃色玩家的總攻中，他過於深入，損失了大量主力部隊。與此同時，對手發現了他城牆上的一個缺口，大舉入侵他的基地，導致他最終戰敗。
- **結尾**：Hera雖然一勝一負，但他對「殊死戰」模式給予了極高評價。他解釋說，這個模式限制了所有玩家的經濟潛力，使得比賽更注重戰術、微操與策略，而非單純的經濟碾壓，這讓他感到非常有趣且平衡。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **「殊死戰」模式的平衡性**：此模式限制了所有玩家只能擁有一個城鎮中心，有效防止了多打少對戰中，某位玩家透過瘋狂擴張經濟(Booming)來碾壓對手的局面。
2.  **村民的價值極高**：由於無法建造新城鎮中心來快速補充村民，在此模式下損失任何一個村民都極為致命，經濟效率至關重要。
3.  **勝利條件的轉變**：遊戲的重點從經濟發展轉變為如何用有限的資源保護自己的城鎮中心，並有效地摧毀敵方的城鎮中心。
4.  **戰術失誤的代價**：即使是職業選手，一個小小的戰術失誤（如過度追擊或城牆出現缺口）都可能在多位對手的圍攻下被迅速放大，並導致崩盤。
5.  **單位克制的極致運用**：Hera在第一局中展示了如何透過單位克制（象兵對抗矛兵）來瓦解對手的聯合防線，這是單一TC經濟下取勝的關鍵。

## 精彩時刻
- **潛行投石機**：第一局最精彩的時刻，莫過於Hera派出一臺投石機，從地圖的角落緩慢爬向敵方基地，在對手完全沒察覺的情況下，一舉摧毀其城鎮中心，奠定勝局。
- **火槍騎兵的讚歌**：在第二局中，Hera對中國的火槍騎兵讚不絕口，稱其為「有點OP(過強)」的單位，並享受其獨特的「開火」機制帶來的操作樂趣。
- **戲劇性的翻盤**：第二局從Hera利用火槍騎兵全面壓制，到因城牆缺口被突破而在幾分鐘內迅速潰敗，整個過程充滿了戲劇性。
- **Hera的幽默感**：他開玩笑說，只要損失一個村民5點血，他就會覺得「我要死了」，並時不時地拿自己的Patreon開玩笑。

# Age of Empires II: Hera's 1v4 "Sudden Death" Mode Experiment

## TL;DR
Pro player Hera tests a novel "Sudden Death" mode in a 1v4 match, where losing your starting Town Center means instant defeat. He wins the first game with a strategic Elephant push and loses the second due to a tactical error, but ultimately praises the mode for its balance, solving the economic disparity common in traditional 1v4s and making the games more intense.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: Hera introduces the new "Sudden Death" game mode: a 1v4 where any player who loses their single, irreplaceable Town Center is eliminated. He sets out to play two games under these rules.
- **Middle**:
    - **Game 1**: Hera picks Malay, planning to age up quickly and win with powerful Imperial Age units. After defending against his opponents' combined scout rush, he transitions into Battle Elephants, which prove to be a devastating counter to their Skirmisher-heavy armies. He first destroys the red player's TC with elephants, then sneakily sends a single trebuchet across the corner of the map to snipe the blue player's TC while creating a diversion with his main army, securing the win.
    - **Game 2**: Hera gets Chinese on random and opts for a fast Castle Age into Fire Lancers. He gains a huge advantage with the Fire Lancer's mobility and burst damage in early raids. However, he overcommits during an all-in attack on the yellow player, losing a large portion of his army. Simultaneously, his opponents find a hole in his wall and swarm his base, leading to his defeat.
- **End**: Despite a 1-1 record, Hera gives the Sudden Death mode a glowing review. He explains that by capping everyone's economic potential, the mode shifts the focus to tactics, micro, and strategy over pure economic booming, which he finds incredibly fun and balanced.

## Key Insights
1.  **Balance in "Sudden Death" Mode**: Capping all players to one Town Center prevents the common 1v4 scenario where one opponent can "boom" with a massive economy and overwhelm the single player.
2.  **Villagers are Extremely Valuable**: Since you can't build new TCs to quickly replace villagers, losing even one is incredibly punishing, making economic efficiency paramount.
3.  **A Shift in Win Condition**: The game's focus shifts from economic development to protecting your own TC while strategically and efficiently destroying an opponent's.
4.  **The High Cost of Tactical Errors**: Even for a pro, a single mistake (like overextending an attack or having a gap in your wall) can be quickly exploited by multiple opponents and lead to a swift collapse.
5.  **Masterful Use of Unit Counters**: In Game 1, Hera demonstrated how leveraging hard counters (Elephants vs. Skirmishers) is key to breaking a combined front with a limited one-TC economy.

## Notable Moments
- **The Sneaky Trebuchet**: The highlight of Game 1 was Hera sending a lone trebuchet on a long, slow journey across the map corner to snipe an enemy TC while the opponent was completely distracted, clinching the game.
- **Ode to the Fire Lancer**: In Game 2, Hera couldn't stop praising the Chinese Fire Lancer, calling the unit "low-key broken" and delighting in the fun of its unique "gunshot" charge attack mechanic.
- **The Dramatic Turnaround**: The second game's shift from Hera dominating with raids to being defeated in minutes after a hole was found in his wall was incredibly dramatic.
- **Hera's Humor**: He joked about his tendency to feel like "I'm dead" after taking minor damage and made recurring, self-aware jokes about his Patreon.
