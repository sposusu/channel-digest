# 世紀帝國2攻城塔的意外演變：從翻牆工具到戰術計程車

## 重點摘要
《世紀帝國2》的攻城塔最初是為了讓步兵單位翻越城牆而設計的冷門單位，但因成本過高而乏人問津。在最近一次更新大幅降低其造價後，玩家社群不僅重拾其翻牆功能，更意外開發出「計程車戰術」——利用其高血量與駐紮後的加速能力，將步兵安全快速地運送到敵人腹地進行騷擾，這個非預期的用途甚至比其原始設計更為強大與主流。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 影片首先介紹了《世紀帝國2》中多樣的攻城武器，並點出攻城塔的獨特定位：讓單位直接「跳」過城牆，而非摧毀它們。這個單位在「非洲王國」資料片中首次登場，旨在對抗過度防禦的「龜縮」玩家，但其高昂的成本（200木160金）使其在過去七八年間一直是非常小眾的選擇。

- **中段：** 近期的一次更新將攻城塔的成本大砍至100木120金，使其變得極具性價比。這讓它在特定策略中（如競技場地圖上的哥德衛隊突襲）重獲新生。然而，其原始用法有明顯缺點：操作笨重、容易被第二層牆壁克制，且跳進去的單位無法返回，形同單程票。

- **結尾：** 玩家社群發揮創意，開發出全新的「計程車戰術」。他們將10個步兵單位（如長劍兵或擲斧兵）裝入攻城塔，利用其駐兵後獲得的高額血量、防禦與媲美騎士的移動速度，像計程車一樣在敵方陣地橫衝直撞。這個戰術能有效保護單位免受箭塔和城堡的傷害，並完美克制高階對局中常見的僧侶防守（因為僧侶很難轉換高速移動的攻城塔），成為當前版本更主流、更強大的用法。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **平衡性更新的意外後果：** 開發者降低成本的原意是為了鼓勵玩家使用攻城塔翻牆，卻無意中催生了一個他們未曾預料到的、更強大的「計程車」戰術。
2.  **玩家創意驅動戰術革新：** 《世紀帝國2》社群的創造力將一個功能單一的冷門單位，轉變為一個多功能的戰術核心，展示了玩家如何重新定義遊戲工具的價值。
3.  **「計程車戰術」的威力核心：** 此戰術的強大之處在於攻城塔成為一個移動堡壘，它不僅速度快、能扛傷害，最關鍵的是它能有效反制僧侶，解決了步兵單位在進攻時的一大天敵。
4.  **風險與回報的轉變：** 最初的翻牆用法是一次性的高風險奇襲，一旦被識破就失效。而計程車戰術即使被對手看到，也很難有效反制，成為一種持續性的騷擾壓力。
5.  **遊戲設計的兩難：** 攻城塔的演變引出一個有趣的討論：這種由玩家創造的「非預期玩法」是健康的戰術演化，還是破壞遊戲初衷的「濫用」？

## 精彩時刻
- **經典重現：** 提到早期利用攻城塔實現的「三家互市養哥德」戰術，讓哥德衛隊在20分鐘前就海起來，直接翻牆淹沒對手。
- **「計程車戰術」的誕生：** 影片生動地描述了這個戰術的運作方式：步兵進塔、衝鋒、出塔作戰、再回塔內，像搭計程車一樣靈活。
- **驚人的速度：** 一個令人驚訝的事實：當攻城塔駐紮10個步兵單位時，其移動速度快到能媲美一隻沒有點「品種」科技的騎士。
- **僧侶的惡夢：** 攻城塔的高速移動和機制，讓僧侶即使學了「救贖」也幾乎無法對其進行轉換，使其成為僧侶防線的完美突破口。

# The Unexpected Evolution of the Siege Tower: From Wall-Hopper to Tactical Taxi

## TL;DR
The Siege Tower in Age of Empires 2 was a niche unit designed for hopping infantry over walls, but it was too expensive to see much use. After a recent patch dramatically cut its cost, the community not only revived its wall-hopping function but also invented the "Taxi Strategy"—using its high HP and garrisoned speed boost to safely transport infantry for raids. This unintended use has become even more powerful and meta-defining than its original purpose.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The video introduces AoE2's diverse siege weapons, highlighting the Siege Tower's unique role: letting units "jump" over walls instead of destroying them. Introduced in the African Kingdoms expansion, it was meant to counter overly defensive players, but its high cost (200 wood, 160 gold) kept it a niche pick for the last 7-8 years.

- **Middle:** A recent patch slashed the Siege Tower's cost to a much more reasonable 100 wood and 120 gold, making it viable. This revived its intended use in specific strategies (like the Goth Huskarl sling on Arena). However, its original use has clear downsides: it's clunky, easily countered by a second layer of walls, and units that jump over are trapped on a one-way trip.

- **End:** The community got creative and developed the "Taxi Strategy." Players garrison 10 infantry units inside the tower, leveraging its resulting high HP, armor, and knight-like speed to "taxi" units around the enemy base. This tactic protects units from TC/castle fire and, crucially, hard-counters the monk defense common in high-level play (as monks struggle to convert the fast-moving tower). This has become its more dominant and powerful use in the current meta.

## Key Insights
1.  **Unforeseen Consequences of Balancing:** The developers' price reduction was intended to encourage wall-hopping, but it inadvertently created a more powerful and entirely different "taxi" meta they likely never anticipated.
2.  **Player Creativity Drives the Meta:** The AoE2 community's ingenuity transformed a single-purpose, niche unit into a versatile tactical weapon, showing how players can redefine a tool's purpose far beyond its original design.
3.  **The Core Power of the "Taxi Strategy":** The strategy is potent because the Siege Tower becomes a mobile fortress. It's fast and tanky, but its most critical advantage is its ability to neutralize monks, solving a major weakness for offensive infantry.
4.  **A Shift in Risk vs. Reward:** The original wall-hop was a high-risk, one-shot surprise attack that failed if scouted. The taxi strategy, however, is difficult to counter even when seen coming, creating a source of constant, oppressive pressure.
5.  **A Game Design Dilemma:** The Siege Tower's evolution raises a fascinating question: is this emergent, player-driven gameplay a sign of a healthy meta, or is it an "abuse" of mechanics that strays too far from the game's intended spirit?

## Notable Moments
- **A Classic Strategy:** The video references the "triple sling Goth" strategy, where a Goth player would be boomed to Imperial Age before 20 minutes and use Siege Towers to flood opponents with Huskarls.
- **The "Taxi Strategy" is Born:** The video vividly describes how the tactic works: infantry get in, the tower charges in, units pop out to fight, then get back in to run away—just like a taxi.
- **Surprising Speed:** An amazing fact revealed is that a Siege Tower with 10 infantry garrisoned moves as fast as a knight without the Husbandry upgrade.
- **The Monk's Nightmare:** The tower's high speed and mechanics make it nearly impossible for monks to convert, even with the Redemption upgrade, making it the perfect counter to a defensive monk line.
