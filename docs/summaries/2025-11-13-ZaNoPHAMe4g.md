# 從「小哥」被抓版權，談棒球YouTuber的生存困境與版權迷思

## 重點摘要
一位遵守規則的棒球YouTuber，在看見盜用版權的「小哥」頻道被下架後，分享了自己過去的版權掙扎與心路歷程。他認為，雖然這次的處置讓人感到一絲公平，但由於官方授權管道對個人創作者幾乎關閉，導致盜版者仍能輕易獲利並捲土重來，整個創作環境的根本問題依然未解。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片從一則新聞切入——知名的棒球YouTuber「小哥的棒球夾克」因版權問題被永久關播。但動手的不是MLB官方，而是台灣的轉播代理商「愛爾達電視」。
- **中段**：敘事者（駕馭）分享自己是台灣第一個遇到版權問題的棒球YouTuber。他在2018年因使用球員照片被MLB警告，從此改變風格，不再使用未授權素材，甚至改用小畫家畫圖。他揭露，個人創作者幾乎不可能買到MLB的影片授權，即便有機會合作，條件也極其嚴苛，無法營利且流程繁瑣，讓他感到挫折。他坦言，看著小哥靠盜用影片輕鬆獲得上億觀看和估計超過兩千萬台幣的收入，讓他感到極度不平衡，甚至開始懷疑自己堅持原則是否錯誤。
- **結尾**：對於小哥頻道被下架，他感到「心理稍微平衡一點」。但他發現小哥馬上用新頻道捲土重來，並預測對方未來會轉向盜用更難追查的國外訪談節目。他總結，只要盜用的懲罰（僅關閉頻道）遠低於潛在暴利，且沒有合法的授權管道，這類問題就會不斷發生。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **官方授權對個人創作者遙不可及**：MLB等大型體育聯盟的影音授權，對個人創作者而言，幾乎是「非賣品」，無論是價格或管道都充滿阻礙。
2.  **劣幣驅逐良幣的創作環境**：遵守版權規則的創作者，在內容吸引力上難以與大量使用精彩畫面的盜版者競爭，形成「守規矩的餓死，鑽漏洞的賺飽」的不公平現象。
3.  **盜版的高回報與低風險**：盜版者可透過搬運、AI翻譯等低成本方式，創造巨額流量與收入。即使被抓，最大的懲罰通常只是關閉頻道，賺到的錢早已入口袋，因此毫無嚇阻作用。
4.  **執法漏洞依然存在**：侵權者可輕易轉移陣地，例如改用國外版權方難以追查的節目內容，繼續其商業模式。
5.  **價值觀的衝擊**：當整個社會，包括親友，都在觀看並分享盜版內容時，堅持正版反而會讓創作者感到孤立，甚至產生「是不是我錯了」的自我懷疑。

## 精彩時刻
- **坦誠的嫉妒**：敘事者直白地承認，看到別人靠盜版輕鬆賺大錢，而自己辛苦遵守規則卻步履維艱，內心感到很不平衡甚至嫉妒。
- **驚人的收入估算**：他粗估小哥光是YouTube長影片的收入就可能超過2000萬台幣，還不包含FB和其他分身頻道，讓觀眾對盜版產業的龐大利益有了具體概念。
- **小畫家創作史**：提到自己早期為了規避版權，用「小畫家」畫球員當作替代素材，形成強烈對比。
- **對未來的預測**：他精準預測侵權者下一步會轉向盜用國外體育談話節目，因為這些內容流量高，且原始版權方在海外，幾乎不可能跨海執法。

# On "Xiao Ge's" Copyright Takedown: The Dilemma and Copyright Myths for Baseball YouTubers

## TL;DR
A by-the-books baseball YouTuber reflects on his own struggles with copyright after seeing a popular pirate channel, "Xiao Ge," get taken down. He argues that while the takedown feels like a small victory for fairness, the underlying problem remains unsolved: official licensing is nearly impossible for individual creators, allowing pirates to easily profit, regroup, and thrive in a broken system.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The video starts with the news that a well-known Taiwanese baseball YouTuber, "Xiao Ge's Baseball Jacket," was permanently shut down for copyright infringement. However, the action was taken not by MLB directly, but by its Taiwanese broadcast partner, ELTA TV.
- **Middle:** The narrator (Jia Yu) reveals he was the first Taiwanese baseball YouTuber to face copyright issues back in 2018 for using player photos. After being warned by MLB, he changed his style, stopped using unauthorized materials, and even resorted to drawing players in MS Paint. He explains that it's virtually impossible for individual creators to license MLB footage; his one chance to collaborate came with such strict, non-monetizable, and cumbersome conditions that it was unsustainable. He candidly admits that watching Xiao Ge effortlessly gain hundreds of millions of views and an estimated NT$20 million+ in revenue from pirated content made him feel deeply unbalanced and even question his own principles.
- **End:** He feels a sense of "psychological balance" now that Xiao Ge's channel is down. However, he notes that Xiao Ge is already back with new channels and predicts he will pivot to pirating foreign talk shows, which are harder to track. He concludes that as long as the punishment (just a channel takedown) is far outweighed by the massive profits, and no legal licensing path exists, the problem will persist.

## Key Insights
1.  **Official Licensing is Inaccessible for Creators:** For individuals, licensing video content from major sports leagues like MLB is practically a "not for sale" item, with insurmountable barriers in both cost and access.
2.  **An Unfair Creative Ecosystem:** Compliant creators who respect copyright cannot compete on content appeal with pirates who use a wealth of exciting footage, creating an environment where rule-breakers get rich while rule-followers struggle.
3.  **Piracy's High Reward and Low Risk:** Pirates can generate enormous traffic and revenue with low-cost methods like re-uploading and AI translation. The typical punishment—a channel takedown—is not a deterrent, as the profits are already secured.
4.  **Enforcement Loopholes Persist:** Infringers can easily shift to pirating content from foreign sources whose copyright holders are unlikely to track or pursue claims overseas.
5.  **The Psychological Toll of Compliance:** When society at large, including friends and family, consumes and shares pirated content, it can make creators who adhere to the rules feel isolated and even doubt their own values, wondering, "Am I the one who's wrong?"

## Notable Moments
- **Candid Jealousy:** The narrator openly admits to feeling jealous and unbalanced seeing someone else get rich easily through piracy while his own rule-abiding efforts were a constant struggle.
- **The Staggering Revenue Estimate:** His rough calculation that Xiao Ge likely earned over NT$20 million (approx. $650,000 USD) from YouTube alone gives a tangible sense of the massive financial incentive behind piracy.
- **The "MS Paint" Era:** He mentions his early workaround for copyright was drawing players himself in "Xiao Hua Jia" (MS Paint), a stark contrast to using slick, official highlights.
- **Predicting the Next Move:** He accurately predicts that infringers will now pivot to pirating foreign sports talk shows, which are high-traffic and nearly impossible for the original overseas copyright holders to police.
