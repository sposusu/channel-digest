# 2025年終回顧與2026展望：AI浪潮下的台灣新格局

## 重點摘要
2025年，台灣在AI浪潮的強力驅動下，經濟與股市表現亮眼，創下歷史新高。這波成長主要由強勁的內資買盤支撐，而非外資。展望2026年，台商正迎來史上最大規模的「出走潮」，將供應鏈重心從中國轉向美洲，同時國內需應對貧富差距擴大與勞動力結構性短缺的挑戰。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 節目以輕鬆的跨年祝福開場，主持人幽默地探討「堅持」與「儀式感」，從跨年演唱會的愛情約定，引導到聽眾持續收聽節目的習慣，並預告將回顧2025年市場與展望2026年趨勢。

- **中段：** 深入分析2025年台灣的經濟表現。首先，點出台股指數大漲一萬點至兩萬八，是靠投信、散戶等內資力量，而非持續賣超的外資。接著，說明AI產業是台灣出口與GDP成長的核心引擎，使台灣經濟成長率遠超日韓，股市總市值躍居全球第九。隨後，話題轉向台商供應鏈的歷史性轉移，大量投資正從中國流向美國與墨西哥，形成「美洲供應鏈」，從科技業到傳統產業，甚至餐飲（八方雲集）與銀行業都已西進美國。最後，探討國內挑戰，包括因財富集中於少數人而擴大的貧富差距、長工時、缺工問題，以及政府應對的政策方向，如調高基本工資、鼓勵退休人士重返職場等。

- **結尾：** 主持人總結，台灣正處於一個「科技與傳產分化」及「台商大規模出走」的重大轉捩點。他鼓勵年輕人勇敢向外發展，並以溫暖幽默的方式感謝聽眾一年來的陪伴，強調財務自由是為了「擁有選擇的自由」。最後在歡樂的跨年氣氛與新年祝福中結束節目。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **內資是台股真正主角：** 近年外資持續賣超台股，但股市卻屢創新高，證明了由本地投信、壽險和散戶組成的「內資」才是市場穩定與成長的基石。
2.  **AI是台灣的單一成長引擎：** 台灣的經濟成長與出口動能幾乎完全依賴AI產業，這也造成了AI相關產業與傳統產業之間巨大的發展分歧。
3.  **史上最大「出走潮」：** 受美中貿易戰影響，台商正進行歷史上最大規模的供應鏈轉移，投資重心從過去的中國、東南亞，大規模轉向美國和墨西哥，以建立全新的北美供應鏈。
4.  **繁榮下的不均加劇：** 儘管人均GDP屢創新高，但台灣的貧富差距（吉尼係數）已超越日韓，多數人的薪資跟不上平均水平，成為政府未來必須面對的重要課題。
5.  **勞動力結構的雙重挑戰：** 台灣面臨缺工問題，同時65歲以上人口的勞動參與率卻遠低於其他已開發國家，顯示勞動環境對中高齡人口不友善，造成人力資源的閒置。

## 精彩時刻
- **明年你還愛我嗎：** 提到某年跨年演唱會預售隔年情侶票，結果第二年許多情侶都已分手，導致現場空位很多，藉此比喻「約定未來比想像中更難」。
- **吉他社的真相：** 主持人分享大學時為了認識女生加入吉他社，結果發現男女比是「九十九比一」，而且那唯一的女生還「死會」了，充滿自嘲的幽默。
- **慶祝聖誕節的理由：** 當小編問耶穌生日跟華人有什麼關係時，主持人開玩笑回答：「因為耶穌的弟弟是洪秀全（中國人），所以過一下也沒什麼問題。」
- **台商出走一條龍：** 不只科技大廠去美國，連銀行、房地產，甚至「八方雲集」都跟著去德州設點，專門賣鍋貼和牛肉麵給台灣工程師，形成完整的產業生態圈。
- **財務自由的真諦：** 「財務自由，從來都不是什麼事都不做，而是你有選擇的自由。」

# 2025 Year-in-Review & 2026 Outlook: Taiwan's New Landscape Under the AI Wave

## TL;DR
In 2025, Taiwan's economy and stock market surged to historic highs, powerfully driven by the AI boom and robust domestic investment, not foreign capital. Looking ahead to 2026, Taiwanese businesses are undergoing a historic exodus, shifting supply chains from China to the Americas, while the nation grapples with a widening wealth gap and structural labor shortages at home.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The show kicks off with lighthearted New Year's greetings. The host humorously reflects on commitment and habits, drawing a parallel between couples' promises at a New Year's concert and the audience's loyalty to the show, before setting the stage for a 2025 review and 2026 forecast.

- **Middle:** The core of the episode is a deep dive into Taiwan's 2025 economic performance. First, the host points out that the stock market's 10,000-point surge to 28,000 was fueled by domestic capital (investment trusts, retail investors), defying massive net selling by foreign investors. He then explains that the AI industry is the core engine behind Taiwan's soaring exports and GDP growth, pushing its economic performance far ahead of Japan and South Korea and making its stock market the 9th largest globally. The narrative then pivots to the historic shift of Taiwanese supply chains, with massive investments flowing from China to the US and Mexico to build a new "Americas supply chain." This trend includes not just tech giants but also banks and even the restaurant chain 8-Way Dumpling. Finally, the focus turns to domestic challenges: a widening wealth gap, long working hours, labor shortages, and potential government policies in response, such as raising the minimum wage and encouraging retirees to re-enter the workforce.

- **End:** The host concludes that Taiwan is at a major turning point, marked by the divergence of its tech and traditional industries and the massive exodus of its businesses. He encourages young people to venture abroad, thanks his audience with warmth and humor for their year-long companionship, and emphasizes that financial freedom is about having the "freedom to choose." The show wraps up with a festive New Year's atmosphere and well wishes.

## Key Insights
1.  **Domestic Capital is the Real Driver:** Foreign investors have been net sellers, yet Taiwan's stock market has repeatedly hit new highs, proving that local investment from trusts, insurers, and retail investors is the true cornerstone of the market's strength.
2.  **AI is Taiwan's Sole Growth Engine:** The nation's economic and export momentum is almost entirely dependent on the AI industry, creating a sharp divide between the booming AI sector and struggling traditional industries.
3.  **The Great Business Exodus:** Driven by the US-China trade war, Taiwanese businesses are undertaking their largest-ever supply chain migration, shifting investment focus from China and Southeast Asia to North America (US and Mexico).
4.  **Inequality Amidst Prosperity:** Despite record-high GDP per capita, Taiwan's wealth gap (Gini coefficient) has surpassed that of Japan and South Korea. This growing inequality is a major challenge for the government.
5.  **Structural Labor Challenges:** Taiwan faces a dual problem of labor shortages in key sectors and a very low labor participation rate among its 65+ population compared to other developed nations, indicating an unfriendly environment for older workers and a waste of human capital.

## Notable Moments
- **"Will You Still Love Me Next Year?":** The host recounts a story of a concert that pre-sold tickets to couples for the following year, only for many to have broken up, leaving numerous empty seats—a metaphor for how "promising the future is harder than we think."
- **The Truth About the Guitar Club:** The host humorously shares his college story of joining the guitar club to meet girls, only to discover the male-to-female ratio was "99 to 1," and the one girl was already in a relationship.
- **A Justification for Celebrating Christmas:** When asked what Jesus's birthday has to do with Chinese people, the host jokingly replies, "Because Jesus's younger brother was Hong Xiuquan (a Chinese historical figure), so it's fine to celebrate."
- **The All-in-One Business Exodus:** It's not just tech firms moving to the US; banks, real estate developers, and even the "8-Way Dumpling" chain are setting up shop in Texas to sell potstickers and beef noodle soup to Taiwanese engineers.
- **The True Meaning of Financial Freedom:** "Financial freedom was never about doing nothing; it's about having the freedom to choose."
