# 該不該簽下江少慶？一場千萬月薪的豪賭分析

## 重點摘要
影片作者認為，儘管江少慶薪水高且傷病風險大，但統一獅應該簽下他。因為他具備成為頂級本土先發的「稀有性」，這種潛力在市場上絕無僅有，用一年的合約進行這場高報酬的賭注是值得的。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：作者對於統一獅考慮簽下高風險投手江少慶的新聞感到意外，因為統一過去在自由球員市場上向來保守。這促使他想深入探討這個議題的正反論點。
- **中段**：作者逐一反駁反對簽下江少D慶的三大論點：
    1.  **預算排擠論**：他質疑省下江少慶的薪水是否真能轉為洋將預算，認為球隊各項預算可能是獨立的。
    2.  **沒錢論**：他釐清球隊沒續約另一位球員林淡，是因不願提供長約，而非沒有單年度的預算。
    3.  **不划算論**：他提出「稀有性」概念，主張像江少慶這種有潛力主宰比賽的本土投手極其罕見，不能單純用CP值衡量。他引用江在2021、2023、2024健康時的優異表現，證明其潛力值得高價投資。
- **結尾**：作者總結，簽下江少慶是一場有限風險（一年合約）下的高潛力投資。他認為即便江只打出部分符合身價的表現，對戰力的提升也遠超市場上其他選擇。他也推測富邦未保護江少慶，是因自身投手戰力充足，等於是把決定權「丟給了統一」。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **稀有性勝過CP值**：評估頂級球員價值時，其獨特性與市場稀有度，遠比單純的性價比（CP值）更重要。為了獲得稀有資產，球隊必須準備「溢價」（Overpay）。
2.  **預算的獨立性**：球隊的本土球員薪資、洋將預算、硬體設施預算可能互不相通。在一個項目省錢，不代表能將該筆資金轉移到另一項目上。
3.  **風險評估的維度**：合約的「長度」是評估風險的關鍵。一份高薪的「一年短約」賭博，和一份綁住未來多年的「長期合約」，是完全不同層級的財務風險。
4.  **潛力值得賭注**：江少慶在健康時所展現的壓制力（如2023年前八場的2.02 ERA+），是聯盟中其他本土投手難以企及的，這種「天花板」的高度讓賭他恢復健康變得有吸引力。
5.  **有限的期望**：作者的期望並非要江少慶投出完全符合千萬身價的成績，而是認為只要他能健康出賽約12場，繳出高於聯盟平均的水準（如EIA+ 120），就已經是成功的補強。

## 精彩時刻
- **核心論點**：「具有稀有性的人，你不可能用符合身價的價格拿到。」
- **具體期望**：「他整季如果吃個12場先發，丟出大概120 EIA+，我覺得這個成績不算是完全在做夢了。」
- **生動比喻**：富邦將江少慶放在25人外，是「把球丟給統一決定」，讓統一來做這個困難的抉擇。
- **精闢分析**：將江少慶的狀況與另一位高薪轉隊的投手黃子鵬類比，說明為了稀有的本土先發戰力，高昂的代價是市場常態。

# Should the Uni-Lions Sign Chiang Shao-Ching? Analyzing a High-Stakes Gamble

## TL;DR
The creator argues that despite Chiang Shao-Ching's high salary and significant injury risk, the Uni-Lions should sign him. This is because he possesses the "scarcity" of a potential top-tier local starting pitcher—a level of talent unavailable elsewhere on the market, making a one-year contract a worthwhile high-reward gamble.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The creator expresses surprise at news that the Uni-Lions are considering signing the high-risk pitcher Chiang Shao-Ching, given their historically conservative approach in the free-agent market. This prompts him to dive into the arguments for and against the move.
- **Middle**: The creator systematically refutes the three main arguments *against* signing Chiang:
    1.  **Budget Conflict**: He questions whether the money saved from Chiang's salary could actually be reallocated to the foreign player budget, suggesting team budgets might be separate.
    2.  **Lack of Funds**: He clarifies that the team's failure to re-sign another player, Lin Tan, was due to an unwillingness to offer a long-term contract, not a lack of single-year funds.
    3.  **Poor Value**: He introduces the concept of "scarcity," arguing that dominant local pitchers like Chiang are so rare that they can't be judged on cost-performance alone. He points to Chiang's excellent performances in 2021, 2023, and 2024 when healthy as proof of his high-upside potential.
- **End**: The creator concludes that signing Chiang is a high-potential investment with limited risk (a one-year contract). He believes that even if Chiang performs at a level below his salary, the boost to the team's strength would far exceed other available options. He also speculates that the Fubon Guardians didn't protect Chiang due to their own pitching depth, essentially "tossing the ball to the Uni-Lions."

## Key Insights
1.  **Scarcity Trumps Cost-Performance**: When evaluating top-tier players, their uniqueness and market scarcity are more critical than simple cost-effectiveness. To acquire scarce assets, teams must be prepared to "overpay."
2.  **Budget Silos**: A team's budgets for local player salaries, foreign players, and facilities may not be interchangeable. Saving money in one area doesn't guarantee it can be used in another.
3.  **The Dimension of Risk**: Contract "length" is a key factor in risk assessment. A high-salary "one-year gamble" is a fundamentally different financial risk from a "long-term deal" that ties up future finances.
4.  **Potential is Worth the Gamble**: The dominance Chiang Shao-Ching displayed when healthy (e.g., a 2.02 ERA+ in his first eight 2023 starts) is a ceiling few other local pitchers can reach, making a bet on his return to health attractive.
5.  **Tempered Expectations**: The creator isn't expecting a performance that fully matches Chiang's high salary. He suggests that if Chiang could stay healthy for about 12 starts and post above-average numbers (e.g., a 120 ERA+), it would already be a successful reinforcement.

## Notable Moments
- **Core Argument**: "For a player with scarcity, you can't expect to get them at a price that matches their on-field value."
- **Specific Expectation**: "If he could pitch 12 starts for the whole season and post an ERA+ of around 120, I don't think that's a complete dream."
- **Vivid Analogy**: Describing Fubon's move to leave Chiang unprotected as "tossing the ball to the Uni-Lions to make the decision."
- **Incisive Analysis**: Comparing Chiang's situation to that of Huang Tzu-Peng, another player acquired at a high cost, to illustrate that paying a premium for scarce local starting pitching is the market norm.
