# 世紀帝國2：為何高棉(Khmer)是神級文明？職業玩家才知道的秘密

## 重點摘要
高棉之所以被評為S級頂尖文明，並非因為其著名的戰象，而是源於其強大的早期經濟加成和獨特的防禦機制。這些優勢催生了其他文明難以匹敵的極速戰術，並使他們在遊戲前期極難被攻擊，從而一開始就牢牢掌握比賽節奏。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片首先將高棉與那些優勢明顯的文明（如波希米亞）進行對比，指出高棉的強大之處對休閒玩家來說相當隱晦，但職業選手卻因其獨特潛力而將其視為頂級選擇。
- **中段**：接著，影片深入剖析了高棉之所以強大的四個核心原因：
    1.  **早期經濟節省**：升級時代或解鎖建築無需前置建築，這意味著可以直接跳過軍營（省下175木材和建造時間）直奔馬廄或射箭場。此外，農田的食物會直接進入庫存，無需農民返回城鎮中心或磨坊，極大化了食物收集效率。
    2.  **獨特的戰術流程**：基於上述優勢，高棉可以使用極端的戰術，例如16村民無織布的超快速封建斥侯開局，或是在13分鐘左右就能升上城堡時代，因為他們在封建時代無需建造市場和兵工廠。
    3.  **房屋駐紮防禦**：村民可以駐紮在房屋中。這不僅僅是防禦，而是「不可思議的防禦」。職業玩家會利用「跳房」戰術，讓村民在房屋間快速進出，躲避攻擊甚至反殺、圍困敵方單位，使對手進攻的風險極高。
    4.  **蠍子防線**：進入城堡時代後，高棉的蠍子（弩炮）擁有+1射程，總射程達到8，超越了絕大多數遠程單位（如弩兵、投石車）。這使得高棉的蠍子防線極難被突破，能在敵人進入攻擊範圍前就造成大量傷害。
- **結尾**：影片承認高棉在遊戲後期缺少一些關鍵科技（如拇指環、步兵最終護甲），這會讓某些組合變弱。然而，他們強大的戰象部隊可作為「致命一擊」。結論是，高棉並非新手友善的文明，但一旦玩家花時間理解並善用其獨特優勢，它在任何技術水準的對戰中都極其強大。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **早期優勢遠大於後期優勢**：遊戲初期的資源節省（如省下軍營的175木材）對滾雪球效應的影響，遠比遊戲後期的資源加成更為關鍵。
2.  **節奏就是一切**：高棉的經濟加成讓玩家能更快地生產單位（例如早15秒出斥侯），這微小的時間差足以決定你是成為攻擊方還是防守方，從而掌握戰場主動權。
3.  **以防禦作為威懾**：利用房屋駐紮的機制，攻擊高棉村民的風險變得極高，這常常會讓對手根本不敢輕易嘗試，從而為高棉玩家創造了一個安全的發展環境。
4.  **射程壓制的威力**：8射程的蠍子是高棉城堡時代的防守核心。它能無損消耗來犯的敵軍，迫使他們不斷後撤，難以組織起有效的攻勢。
5.  **潛力需要學習解鎖**：高棉的強大並非唾手可得。玩家必須投入時間去學習和練習其非傳統的經濟運營和防禦技巧，才能完全發揮這個文明的恐怖潛力。

## 精彩時刻
- 「這就是攻擊與防守的差別，在職業賽場上，這是天壤之別。」 (It's the difference between attacking and defending, which is absolutely massive in pro play.)
- 「房屋駐紮不只是好用的防禦，而是『不可思議』的防禦。」 (House hopping isn't just good for defense. It's incredible for defense.)
- 「你到底該在什麼時候進攻高棉玩家？我沒有答案。這就是他們如此強大的原因。」 (When are you supposed to attack the Khmer player? I don't have an answer. That's why they're so strong.)

# Age of Empires 2: Why the Khmer are an S-Tier Civilization

## TL;DR
The Khmer are rated as an S-tier civilization not because of their famous elephants, but due to powerful early-game economic bonuses and unique defensive mechanics. These advantages enable incredibly fast strategies that are difficult for other civs to counter and make the Khmer surprisingly hard to attack, allowing them to control the game's tempo from the very beginning.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The video starts by contrasting the Khmer with obviously powerful civilizations like the Bohemians, pointing out that while Khmer strengths are subtle to casual players, they are considered a top-tier choice by pros for their unique potential.
- **Middle**: The video then dives deep into the four core reasons for the Khmer's power:
    1.  **Early Game Savings**: No prerequisite buildings are needed to advance ages or unlock other buildings. This means you can skip the Barracks (saving 175 wood and villager build time) and go directly for a Stable or Archery Range. Additionally, farms deposit food directly into the stockpile without needing a drop-off site, maximizing food collection efficiency.
    2.  **Unique Build Orders**: These bonuses enable extreme strategies, such as a 16-population, no-loom, fast-feudal scout rush, or reaching the Castle Age around the 13-minute mark because they don't need to build a Market and Blacksmith in the Feudal Age.
    3.  **House Garrison Defense**: Villagers can garrison inside houses. This isn't just a good defense; it's an "incredible defense." Pros use "house hopping" to quickly move villagers in and out of houses to dodge attacks, counter-attack, and even trap enemy units, making any engagement extremely risky for the opponent.
    4.  **Scorpion Defense**: In the Castle Age, Khmer Scorpions get +1 range, for a total of 8. This outranges the vast majority of other ranged units (like Crossbows and Mangonels). This makes the Khmer Scorpion line incredibly difficult to break, as they can inflict heavy damage before the enemy is even in range to attack.
- **End**: The video acknowledges that the Khmer lack some key technologies in the late game (like Thumb Ring and the final infantry armor), which can make some unit compositions weaker. However, their powerful Battle Elephants serve as a "finishing blow." The conclusion is that the Khmer are not a beginner-friendly civ, but once a player invests time to understand and leverage their unique advantages, they become exceptionally powerful at all skill levels.

## Key Insights
1.  **Early Advantages Outweigh Late-Game Bonuses**: Resource savings in the early game (like the 175 wood from skipping a barracks) have a far greater snowball effect than resource bonuses in the late game.
2.  **Tempo is Everything**: The Khmer's economic bonuses allow for faster unit production (e.g., getting a scout out 15 seconds earlier). This small time difference can determine whether you are the attacker or the defender, allowing you to seize initiative.
3.  **Defense as a Deterrent**: The house-garrisoning mechanic makes attacking Khmer villagers so risky that opponents often won't even try, creating a safe environment for the Khmer player to boom.
4.  **The Power of Range Supremacy**: The 8-range Scorpion is the cornerstone of Khmer's Castle Age defense. It can get free hits on approaching armies, forcing them to retreat and making it nearly impossible to mount an effective assault.
5.  **Potential Must Be Unlocked**: The Khmer's strength is not immediately obvious. Players must invest time to learn and practice their unconventional economic management and defensive techniques to fully unleash the civilization's terrifying potential.

## Notable Moments
- "It's the difference between attacking and defending, which is absolutely massive in pro play."
- "House hopping isn't just good for defense. It's incredible for defense."
- "When are you supposed to attack the Khmer player? I don't have an answer. That's why they're so strong."
