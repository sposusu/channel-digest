# 為何高棉 (Khmer) 是《世紀帝國2》的頂級文明？

## 重點摘要
高棉文明的強大之處並非表面上看起來的大象或攻城武器，而是其極為強勢的早期經濟優勢和獨特的戰術彈性。這些「措辭古怪」的加成讓他們在遊戲前期就能節省大量資源、發動奇襲，並建立起難以攻破的防禦，使其成為職業選手眼中的 S 級文明。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片開頭點出，不像許多文明的強項顯而易見，高棉的實力對新手玩家來說相當隱晦。多數人以為他們是個依賴大象的後期文明，但事實遠非如此。
- **中段**：影片的核心論點圍繞四大關鍵：
    1.  **早期經濟節省**：高棉不需蓋軍營即可解鎖馬廄和射箭場，直接省下 175 木材與村民建造時間。此外，農田食物會直接存入國庫，無需等待村民送回，大幅提升了早期食物採集效率與出兵速度。
    2.  **獨特戰術**：這些優勢催生了其他文明無法複製的戰術，例如極速封建（16 村民無織布機）的斥侯快攻，或是 13 分鐘就能升上城堡時代的超快打法，同時經濟依然強勁。
    3.  **房屋駐紮**：村民可以駐紮在房屋中，這不僅是防守神技（俗稱「跳房子」），更能引誘敵軍、消耗其單位生命值，讓對手在騷擾時投鼠忌器。
    4.  **蠍子海防線**：城堡時代的弩炮（蠍子）擁有 +1 射程，總射程達到 8，超越了絕大多數遠程單位（如弩兵、投石車），使其在防守時能無損耗地消滅來犯敵軍。
- **結尾**：影片總結，高棉雖然在遊戲大後期缺少一些關鍵科技，但其從黑暗到城堡時代的統治力，早已奠定勝基。後期的大象只是壓垮對手的「最後一擊」。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **早期優勢 > 後期優勢**：遊戲初期的資源節省，其影響力遠遠大於後期。高棉的加成完美體現了這一點。
2.  **打破規則的強大**：跳過前置建築（如軍營）的能力，徹底改變了傳統的開局策略與節奏。
3.  **防禦即是進攻**：強大的防禦能力（如房屋駐紮）能有效嚇阻對手的攻擊，使其不敢輕易交戰，從而浪費時間與兵力。
4.  **射程就是真理**：即使只是 +1 的射程優勢，在關鍵時刻也能完全壓制對手的常規部隊，形成無法逾越的防線。
5.  **真正的實力藏在細節裡**：一個文明的強度可能並非來自其最亮眼的單位，而是那些看似不起眼、甚至「措辭古怪」的經濟與文明加成。

## 精彩時刻
- **「跳房子 (House hopping)」**：利用房屋駐紮機制，讓村民在敵軍面前反覆進出，不僅能保命，還能消耗敵軍血量，甚至設下陷阱。
- **8 射程的弩炮**：在城堡時代，這種弩炮能攻擊對手，而對手卻無法還擊，堪稱防守的惡夢。
- **「高棉整場都在發光發熱」**：點出高棉並非等到大象出場才變強，而是在遊戲的每一個階段都極具威脅性。
- **無恥的業配**：講者在解釋完高棉的強力戰術後，順勢推銷自己 Patreon 上的付費教學，毫不掩飾。

# Why the Khmer are a Top-Tier Civilization in AoE2

## TL;DR
The Khmer's power doesn't come from their obvious elephants or siege, but from their incredibly strong early-game economic bonuses and unique strategic flexibility. These "weirdly worded" bonuses allow them to save massive resources, execute unique rushes, and build an almost impenetrable defense, making them an S-tier civilization for pro players.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The video starts by highlighting that unlike many civilizations whose strengths are obvious, the Khmer's power is hidden from casual players. Most assume they are a late-game elephant civilization, but this couldn't be further from the truth.
- **Middle**: The core argument revolves around four key points:
    1.  **Early-Game Savings**: The Khmer don't need a barracks to unlock the stable and archery range, saving 175 wood and villager build time. Additionally, their farms drop food directly into the stockpile without needing a drop-off, significantly boosting early-game food income and unit production speed.
    2.  **Unique Strategies**: These bonuses enable powerful builds other civs can't replicate, like a 16-pop no-loom fast feudal scout rush, or an incredibly fast 13-minute Castle Age time while still having a strong economy.
    3.  **House Garrisoning**: Villagers can garrison in houses, which is not just a great defensive trick ("house hopping") but can also be used to bait enemies and wear down their units, making raids risky for the opponent.
    4.  **Scorpion Defense**: In Castle Age, their Scorpions get +1 range, for a total of 8 range. This outranges most common ranged units (like crossbows and mangonels), allowing them to destroy attacking armies with zero damage in return.
- **End**: The video concludes that while the Khmer miss a few key late-game technologies, their dominance from the Dark Age through the Castle Age has already secured the game. The late-game elephants are merely the "finishing blow."

## Key Insights
1.  **Early-Game Bonuses > Late-Game Bonuses**: Resource savings in the early game are far more impactful than those in the late game, a concept the Khmer's bonuses perfectly exemplify.
2.  **The Power of Breaking Rules**: The ability to skip prerequisite buildings (like the barracks) fundamentally changes standard opening strategies and tempo.
3.  **Defense is the Best Offense**: A powerful defensive bonus (like house garrisoning) can effectively deter attacks, making the opponent hesitant to engage and forcing them to waste time and army presence.
4.  **Range is King**: Even a +1 range advantage can completely neutralize an opponent's standard counters at critical moments, creating an unbreachable defensive line.
5.  **True Strength is in the Details**: A civilization's power may not lie in its flashiest units, but in subtle, even "weirdly worded," economic and civilization bonuses.

## Notable Moments
- **"House hopping"**: The tactic of repeatedly garrisoning and ungarrisoning villagers in houses to save them, chip away at enemy HP, and even set traps.
- **The 8-Range Scorpion**: A Castle Age unit that can attack opponents while they can't fight back, making it a defensive nightmare.
- **"The Khmer have been shining the entire game"**: A quote emphasizing that the Khmer are a threat at every stage, long before their famous elephants appear.
- **The Shameless Plug**: After explaining the Khmer's powerful strategies, the narrator seamlessly transitions into advertising his Patreon guides for executing them.
