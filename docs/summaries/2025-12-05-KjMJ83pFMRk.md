# Hera 與好友在《世紀帝國2》中施展完美的團隊戰術

## 重點摘要
職業選手 Hera 與隊友們設計了一套強大的 4v4 戰術。透過讓一名土耳其玩家快速升上帝王時代以取得早期戰力高峰，他們成功搶下地圖控制權，並以完美協同的軍隊組合壓倒對手，贏得一場迅速而決定性的勝利。

## 故事大綱
- 開場：團隊由 Hera 帶領，討論各文明優勢並制定計畫：土耳其「快帝」以取得早期火砲、西班牙爆量聖殿騎士、高棉製造弩砲象、英國則提供長弓兵支援。他們在中路打了一場簡短而成功的斥侯戰。
- 中段：敵方試圖用西西里傭兵進行輕度騷擾，但被輕易守下。在隊友的資源支持下，土耳其玩家 Peter 成功遠超眾人，率先升上帝王時代，並開始生產強大的火槍兵與火砲。
- 結尾：Peter 的土耳其軍隊迅速推進至中央山丘，摧毀敵方前線建築並輕鬆擊退反擊。這波早期強攻的壓倒性力量，迫使敵方全體在遊戲中期便提早投降。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **團隊組合的協同效應是關鍵**：結合快攻（土耳其）、前線（西班牙聖殿騎士）與後排（英國長弓兵）的組合，能創造出近乎無敵的軍隊。
2.  **早期地圖控制決定賽局**：Peter 的快帝戰術讓團隊搶下關鍵的中央山丘，提供了強大的戰略優勢，從而主導遊戲節奏。
3.  **團隊合作與資源共享**：團隊的成功取決於他們的協調能力，隊友們將資源輸送給核心玩家 (Peter)，以加速他的發展與軍事生產。
4.  **「戰力高峰」的力量**：土耳其玩家提前抵達帝王時代，創造了一個巨大的暫時優勢（戰力高峰），讓對手束手無策，有效地在遊戲真正開始前就結束了比賽。
5.  **以宏觀策略應對騷擾**：面對敵方早期的壓力，團隊沒有過度反應，而是專注於更大的經濟和戰略計畫，相信後期的發展會帶來回報。

## 精彩時刻
- Hera 開玩笑說，因為他 10 天沒直播了，對手可能不相信真的是他本人。
- 敵方的草原槍兵軍隊在 Peter 的火槍兵面前瞬間蒸發，Hera 團隊的玩家驚呼：「一個單位都沒死。」
- 在意識到大勢已去後，敵方全體同時投降，讓 Hera 團隊感到驚訝又好笑。

# Hera & Friends Execute a Flawless Team Strategy in AoE2

## TL;DR
Pro player Hera and his teammates devised a powerful 4v4 strategy. By having one player (Turks) rush to the Imperial Age for an early power spike, they seized map control and overwhelmed their opponents with a perfectly synergistic army composition, leading to a swift and decisive victory.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The team, led by Hera, discusses their civilization strengths and formulates a plan: Turks will perform a "Fast Imp" for early cannons, Spanish will mass Paladins, Khmer will build Ballista Elephants, and Britons will provide Longbow support. They have a brief, successful scout fight in the middle.
- **Middle:** The opponents attempt a light rush with Sicilian Sergeants, which is easily defended. Supported by resources from his teammates, the Turkish player, Peter, successfully reaches the Imperial Age far ahead of everyone else and begins producing powerful Hand Cannoneers and Bombard Cannons.
- **End:** Peter's Turkish army advances to the central hill, destroying enemy forward buildings and effortlessly repelling a counter-attack. The overwhelming power of this early push forces the entire enemy team to resign prematurely in the mid-game.

## Key Insights
1.  **Synergistic Team Composition is Key:** Combining a fast-im rush player (Turks), a strong frontline (Spanish Paladins), and backline support (Briton Longbows) creates a nearly unstoppable force.
2.  **Early Map Control Dictates the Game:** Peter's "Fast Imp" strategy allowed his team to seize the crucial central hill, providing a powerful strategic advantage to control the game's flow.
3.  **Teamwork & Resource Sharing:** The team's success hinged on their ability to coordinate, with players sending resources to the core player (Peter) to accelerate his boom and military production.
4.  **The Power of a "Power Spike":** The Turkish player reaching the Imperial Age created a massive, temporary advantage (a "power spike") that the opponents had no answer for, effectively ending the game before it truly began.
5.  **Countering Harassment with Macro Strategy:** Instead of overreacting to early pressure, the team defended minimally while focusing on their larger economic plan, knowing their boom would pay off.

## Notable Moments
- Hera joking that opponents wouldn't believe it was him since he hadn't streamed in 10 days.
- The enemy's Steppe Lancer army melting instantly against Peter's Hand Cannoneers, with a team member exclaiming, "Literally not one unit died there."
- The entire enemy team resigning simultaneously after realizing the game was lost, which was both surprising and amusing to Hera's team.
