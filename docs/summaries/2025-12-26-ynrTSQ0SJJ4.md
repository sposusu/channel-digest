# LTT的失敗產品博物館：那些從未上市的腦洞設計

## 重點摘要
LTT 團隊揭開了他們產品開發背後的「失敗墳場」，展示了從 RGB 門墊、可組合的「水瓶法杖」到羊絨連帽衫等大量從未上市的產品原型。影片的核心訊息是，創造產品極其困難、昂貴且充滿反覆，即使是成功的團隊，背後也堆積了無數被放棄的點子和慘痛的教訓。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：Linus 以耗時多年的螺絲刀為例，強調產品開發的艱辛。接著他話鋒一轉，表示要藉由 YouTube Shopping 的贊助，來一場「失敗產品」的幕後大公開，讓粉絲和「黑粉」們都能看個過癮。
- **中段**：Linus 依序請出工程和時尚團隊，共同回顧一系列失敗的專案。
    - **工程團隊的黑歷史**：展示了需求不斷變更的「RGB 迎賓墊」、因專利和愚蠢而告終的「RGB 水瓶法杖」、因過於複雜且錯過市場時機而血本無歸（剩下十萬美元晶片庫存）的「模組化電競滑鼠」、以及因成本和運輸問題而放棄的「全金屬鍵帽」和「DIY 吸音板」。
    - **時尚團隊的創傷回憶**：介紹了因模具成本太高而作罷的「涼鞋」、屢次測試都失敗的「皮帶」、因與現有產品撞設計而放棄的「資料夾錢包」、因口袋位置尷尬（會打到胸部）而失敗的「遊戲機連帽衫」、歷經八次打樣仍搞不定版型的「羊絨連帽衫」、以及因洗滌後會掉漆而放棄的「RGB 羊毛夾克」和「卡通風格夾克」。
- **結尾**：在回顧了所有「夭折的孩子」後，Linus 再次推廣他們最終成功的螺絲刀產品，並感謝贊助商，結束了這場充滿自嘲和辛酸的產品失敗回顧展。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **從點子到產品的鴻溝**：一個絕妙的點子，在現實中可能因成本、技術限制、材料、專利或市場時機等因素而變得完全不可行。
2.  **迭代的巨大成本**：產品開發是「快速失敗」和不斷迭代的過程。每一次修改、每一次打樣，都意味著時間和金錢的巨大投入，例如羊絨連帽衫的 8 次打樣花費了數千美元。
3.  **「殺死專案」的智慧**：知道何時該放棄一個專案至關重要。許多產品雖然很酷，但因複雜性、缺乏明確市場或與現有產品線重疊而被終止，這是一種必要的商業決策。
4.  **跨部門協作的挑戰**：當工程團隊遇上時尚團隊，會產生創意火花，但也會帶來巨大的溝通成本和製造公差上的挑戰，如 DIY 吸音板的布套就是一個例子。
5.  **透明度的價值**：公開分享失敗並非壞事。它不僅能讓觀眾了解產品開發的真實面貌，更能建立社群的信任感和忠誠度。

## 精彩時刻
- **鼠標晶片大甩賣**：「有人想買點鼠標處理器嗎？任何人？」——在解釋為電競滑鼠專案購買了價值 10 萬美元卻從未使用的晶片時。
- **老闆的任性需求**：「我最初的指令是：我想要站上去，然後它會亮 RGB 燈。」——工程師吐槽 Linus 對 RGB 門墊專案提出的初始要求，而這僅僅是後續一連串修改的開始。
- **為影片聯繫前任**：時尚團隊的 Matthew 為了在影片中展示錢包原型，不得不聯繫他的前女友並把送出去的樣品要了回來。
- **反向乳頭**：「如果我是女性，剛剛我的乳頭可能就凹進去了。」——展示為攜帶遊戲機而設計的連帽衫時，口袋位置正好打在胸口，非常尷尬。
- **羊絨衫的慘痛教訓**：一件目標是內部員工的頂級連帽衫，最終因為布料和版型問題，在做了 8 次昂貴的樣品後宣告失敗。

# LTT's Museum of Failed Products: The Wild Designs That Never Launched

## TL;DR
The Linus Tech Tips team unveils their "graveyard of failures," showcasing a vast collection of unreleased product prototypes, from an RGB doormat to a modular "Staff of Hydration" and a cashmere hoodie. The video's core message is that creating products is incredibly difficult, expensive, and iterative, and even successful companies have a long history of abandoned ideas and painful lessons.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: Linus kicks off by highlighting the difficulty of product development, using their multi-year screwdriver project as an example. He then pivots, announcing a sponsored tour of LTT's "failed products" for the entertainment of both fans and "hate watchers."
- **Middle**: Linus brings in the engineering and fashion teams to walk through a series of failed projects.
    - **Engineering's Dark History**: They showcase an "RGB Welcome Mat" with ever-changing requirements, an "RGB Staff of Hydration" killed by patents and absurdity, a "Modular Gaming Mouse" that resulted in a $100,000 write-off in unused ICs due to complexity and missed timing, and an "All-Metal Keycap" and "DIY Acoustic Panels" abandoned over cost and logistics.
    - **The Fashion Team's Trauma**: They cover "Sandals" that died due to high mold costs, "Belts" that failed durability tests, a "Folder Wallet" shelved for being too similar to an existing product, a "Gaming Hoodie" with an awkwardly placed pocket that "punches you in the chest," a "Cashmere Hoodie" that failed after 8 expensive samples couldn't fix the fit, and an "RGB Woolen Jacket" whose reflective effect washed off.
- **End**: After touring all the "failed children," Linus circles back to promote their successful screwdriver, thanks the sponsors, and concludes the self-deprecating and insightful exhibition of product failures.

## Key Insights
1.  **The Chasm Between Idea and Product**: A brilliant concept can be rendered completely unfeasible by real-world constraints like cost, technical limitations, materials, patents, or market timing.
2.  **The Immense Cost of Iteration**: Product development is a process of "failing fast" and constant iteration. Every sample and revision costs significant time and money, exemplified by the 8 samples and thousands of dollars spent on the cashmere hoodie.
3.  **The Wisdom of Killing a Project**: Knowing when to abandon a project is crucial. Many cool products were terminated because they were too complex, lacked a clear market, or overlapped with the existing product line—a necessary business decision.
4.  **The Challenges of Cross-Department Collaboration**: Merging engineering with fashion sparks creativity but also introduces significant communication hurdles and manufacturing tolerance challenges, as seen with the fabric covers for the acoustic panels.
5.  **The Value of Transparency**: Openly sharing failures is not a weakness. It provides the audience with a realistic look at the complexities of product development and, in turn, builds community trust and loyalty.

## Notable Moments
- **Mouse IC Fire Sale**: "Anyone want to buy some mouse processors? Anyone?" — Linus, after explaining they bought $100,000 worth of ICs for the gaming mouse project that were never used.
- **The Client's Whim**: "My exact instructions were: I want to stand on it and it lights up with RGB." — An engineer recalling Linus's initial, and deceptively simple, request for the RGB doormat project.
- **Getting it Back From the Ex**: Matthew from the fashion team had to contact his ex-girlfriend to get a wallet prototype back specifically for the video shoot.
- **The Inverted Nipple**: "If I was more of the feminine persuasion, I would have ended up with an inverted nipple just now." — A comment on the awkward and painful placement of the front pocket on the gaming hoodie.
- **The Cashmere Catastrophe**: A super-premium hoodie, intended only for staff, was ultimately scrapped after 8 expensive samples failed to get the fit right for the chosen heavy fabric.
