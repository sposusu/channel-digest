# Linus Tech Tips 揭曉全新 Short Circuit 攝影棚

## 重點摘要
Linus Tech Tips (LTT) 團隊告別了使用近三年的狹窄臨時攝影棚，為旗下 Short Circuit 頻道打造了一個規模宏大、功能專業的全新永久性攝影棚。這個新空間包含三個獨立的拍攝區域，配備了頂級的 Aputure 燈光系統和高效的工作流程設計，旨在提升影片的製作品質與拍攝彈性。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片開頭展示了舊 Short Circuit 攝影棚的各種問題——空間狹窄、緊鄰收貨區且樓上噪音不斷（被戲稱為「有大象在樓上」），凸顯了升級的迫切性。
- **中段**：Linus 在團隊成員的帶領下，參觀了全新的攝影棚。他們詳細介紹了三個主要區域：(1) 用於拍攝大型產品（如電腦、螢幕）的「家庭辦公室」區；(2) 配備 Aputure Infinibar 燈條打造的酷炫「光牆」作為主要背景的「主拍攝區」；(3) 一個偽裝成吧台、配備升降桌和「假窗戶」電視的「吧台區」，用於拍攝中型產品。整個過程展示了專業的燈光佈局、提升效率的攝影機控制系統，以及未來嘗試「現場剪輯」的計畫。
- **結尾**：影片最後，他們開玩笑地揭曉開場的「拆除」片段其實是電影魔法，舊棚還沒拆。同時也提到了員工休息室為了新棚而被犧牲的趣事，並向超過 20 位參與建設的 LMG 員工致謝，最後宣傳在新棚拍攝的第一批影片。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **「臨時的解決方案就是最長久的解決方案」**：這個貫穿影片的笑話，諷刺了原本「臨時」的攝影棚竟然使用了將近三年之久。
2.  **效率至上的工作流程**：新攝影棚的設計核心是為了實現「準備好就拍」(slate and go) 的高效流程，包含預設好的燈光、集中的攝影機監控，以及用 Sidus App 統一控制所有燈光。
3.  **多樣化的視覺呈現**：將攝影棚設計成「三合一」的空間，旨在為影片封面和內容提供更多元的背景變化，擺脫以往單調的背景板。
4.  **專業設備是品質的基石**：影片中大量展示了 Aputure 的專業燈光設備（如 Infinibars, Nova panels, Storm ADCs），證明高品質、高彈性的燈光是實現專業視覺效果的關鍵。
5.  **回歸初衷**：儘管進行了大規模升級，團隊強調 Short Circuit 頻道的本質——簡單直接的開箱體驗——將會被保留，甚至因為流程優化而變得更純粹。

## 精彩時刻
- **樓上的大象**：用來形容舊攝影棚樓上傳來的巨大噪音，非常生動有趣。
- **命名大師 Linus**：Linus 對內部攝影棚命名混亂的吐槽（例如有好幾個棚都叫「公寓棚」），展現了他對細節的龜毛。
- **寶礦力水得迷你冰箱**：一個看起來很酷的訂製冰箱，結果只是貼了員工女友製作的貼紙，反差感十足。
- **屢敗屢戰的「現場剪輯」**：團隊再次提起嘗試「現場剪輯」這個在 LMG 失敗了十幾年的點子，充滿自嘲精神。
- **電影魔法**：影片結尾揭露「舊棚已被拆除」的開場畫面是假的，增添了戲劇性的幽默感。

# Linus Tech Tips Reveals the NEW Short Circuit Studio

## TL;DR
After nearly three years in a cramped, noisy temporary set, the Linus Tech Tips team has finally built a massive, professional, and permanent new studio for their Short Circuit channel. The new space features three distinct shooting zones, is equipped with high-end Aputure lighting, and is designed for an efficient workflow to elevate production quality and versatility.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The video starts by highlighting the significant problems with the old "temporary" Short Circuit set—it's cramped, next to the main receiving door, and plagued by constant noise from upstairs (jokingly referred to as "elephants"). This establishes the urgent need for an upgrade.
- **Middle:** A team member gives Linus a tour of the expansive new studio. They detail the three main zones: (1) a "home office/den" for large products like PCs and monitors; (2) the "main set" featuring a stunning "glow wall" made of Aputure Infinibars as its primary backdrop; and (3) a "bar" area with a sit-stand desk disguised as an island and a TV acting as a "fake window" for medium-sized items. Throughout the tour, they showcase the professional lighting setup, camera control systems designed for efficiency, and plans to re-attempt a "live-to-tape" editing workflow.
- **End:** The video concludes by revealing that the opening "demolition" scene was just "movie magic" and the old set is still standing. They also joke about the employee lounge that was displaced for the new studio, give a big thank-you to the 20+ LMG staff members involved in the build, and promote the first videos shot in the new space.

## Key Insights
1.  **"No solution is more permanent than a temporary solution"**: This running joke is central to the video, mocking how the "temporary" set ended up being used for almost three years.
2.  **Efficiency-First Workflow**: A core goal of the new set is to enable a "slate and go" process, featuring pre-configured lighting, centralized camera monitoring, and unified light control via the Sidus App.
3.  **Visual Variety is Key**: Designing the studio as a "three-in-one" space aims to provide more diverse backgrounds for thumbnails and content, moving away from simple, static backdrops.
4.  **Professional Gear is the Foundation of Quality**: The video heavily features professional Aputure lighting (Infinibars, Nova panels, Storm ADCs), demonstrating that high-quality, flexible lighting is crucial for achieving a professional look.
5.  **Returning to Core Principles**: Despite the major upgrades, the team emphasizes that Short Circuit's identity as a channel for straightforward unboxings will remain, and will even be enhanced by the streamlined process.

## Notable Moments
- **The Elephants Upstairs**: A vivid and funny metaphor for the loud noises coming from the floor above the old set.
- **Linus the Naming Guru**: Linus's rant about the confusing internal names for their sets (e.g., multiple sets being called "the apartment set") showcases his particular nature.
- **The Pocari Sweat Mini Fridge**: What appears to be a cool custom fridge turns out to be a standard one with a custom sticker made by an employee's girlfriend, creating a humorous anticlimax.
- **The Failed "Live-to-Tape" Idea**: The team's self-deprecating discussion about once again trying "live editing," an idea that has failed at LMG for over a decade.
- **Movie Magic**: The final, dramatic reveal that the intro scene showing the old set's demolition was fake, adding a touch of humor.
