# 利納斯·托瓦茲談論 Linux 與 Git

## 重點摘要
利納斯·托瓦茲（Linus Torvalds）坦言，他對 Linux 的自豪感遠遠超過 Git。他創造 Git 是出於開發 Linux 的實際需求，並在找到合適的維護者後便迅速將其交出，視其為輔助主要專案的工具。

## 故事大綱
- 開場：訪者詢問利納斯·托瓦茲，在他眾多的成就中，他對哪一個最感到驕傲。
- 中段：利納斯毫不猶豫地回答「到目前為止是 Linux」，並解釋大眾普遍高估了他對 Git 的貢獻。他強調自己只做了最初的基礎設計，僅花了六個月時間，目的是為了解決 Linux 開發時的需求。
- 結尾：他表示，一旦找到他認為可以接管的人，他就立刻把 Git「丟了過去」。訪者用一個幽默的比喻總結，說這就像為了「備用零件」而生第二個孩子，來強化第一個孩子。

## 關鍵見解
- 利納斯的主要熱情與長期承諾在於 Linux，而非 Git。
- Git 的誕生是一個務實的解決方案，旨在服務 Linux 的開發。
- 他認為自己的核心貢獻在於 Git 的初期設計，而非長期維護。
- 利納斯信奉在專案穩定後下放權力，讓社群接手。
- 他看待 Git 的視角純粹是功能性的，是一個為達目的（改進 Linux）而創造的工具。

## 精彩時刻
- 利納斯斬釘截鐵的回答：「Linux by far.」（到目前為止是 Linux。）
- 他的直接坦白：「I don't think people understand how little I did for Git.」（我認為人們不了解我為 Git 做的有多麽少。）
- 訪者幽默又略帶暗黑的比喻：「So that's like having a second child so that you could enhance your first child... with spare parts.」（所以這就像為了強化你的第一個孩子…用備用零件…而生下第二個孩子。）

# Linus Torvalds on Linux and Git

## TL;DR
Linus Torvalds reveals he is far more proud of Linux than Git. He created Git purely as a necessary tool for Linux development and handed it off as soon as possible, considering it secondary to his primary project.

## Story Flow
- Beginning: The interviewer asks Linus Torvalds which of his creations he is most proud of.
- Middle: Linus immediately answers "Linux by far," and explains that people overestimate his contribution to Git. He clarifies that he only did the initial design out of necessity for Linux and worked on it for just six months.
- End: He concludes by stating that the moment he found a suitable person to take over, he threw it "over the fence." The interviewer makes a humorous analogy, comparing it to having a second child for "spare parts" to enhance the first.

## Key Insights
- Linus's primary passion and long-term project is Linux, not Git.
- Git was created as a pragmatic solution to a problem in Linux development.
- He sees his core contribution to Git as the initial design, not its long-term maintenance.
- Linus believes in delegating projects once they are functional and a suitable maintainer is found.
- His perspective on Git is purely utilitarian—a tool created as a means to an end (the betterment of Linux).

## Notable Moments
- Linus's emphatic and immediate answer: "Linux by far."
- His blunt admission: "I don't think people understand how little I did for Git."
- The interviewer's humorous and slightly dark analogy: "So that's like having a second child so that you could enhance your first child... with spare parts."
