# 職業選手挑戰《世紀帝國》三國傳奇戰役

## 重點摘要
《世紀帝國II》職業選手 Hera 首次挑戰全新的三國系列戰役（曹操篇），並選擇了傳奇難度。在與聊天室觀眾的互動下，他做出了關鍵的遊戲決策，過程中也因不熟悉的中文名字而鬧出笑話，並驚訝地發現自己扮演的主角曹操竟是一位冷酷無情的梟雄。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** Hera 決定暫時放下競技排名，為他的觀眾遊玩劇情戰役。在懷舊與新內容之間，他被聊天室觀眾慫恿，選擇了在「傳奇」難度下體驗全新的三國曹操篇。
- **中段：** 他成功完成了前兩個任務。首先，他迅速擊潰了黃巾軍，並透過聊天室投票決定赦免僧侶，此舉意外地為他帶來了強大的單位。接著，他轉而對抗暴君董卓，再次讓觀眾為他選擇英雄，並在錯綜複雜的聯盟與背叛中殺出重圍，最終取得勝利。
- **結尾：** 影片在第三個任務開始時結束，此時他必須對抗昔日的朋友袁紹。過場動畫揭示了曹操殘酷的人生哲學：「寧我負人，毋人負我」，讓 Hera 對自己扮演的角色感到震驚。

## 關鍵見解
- **互動式劇情：** 遊戲中的決策（如赦免僧侶）會直接影響遊戲進程，帶來實質的獎勵或後果。
- **梟雄的刻畫：** 劇情描繪了曹操是一位聰明但極度冷酷且多疑的軍閥，為達目的不擇手段，這讓實況主本人也大感意外。
- **傳奇難度的體驗：** 對於頂尖玩家而言，傳奇難度雖有挑戰，但透過積極進攻和善用英雄技能，仍然可以順利通關。
- **觀眾互動的樂趣：** 實況主與聊天室的互動是娛樂的核心，尤其是透過投票來共同決定遊戲走向。
- **複雜的歷史背景：** 遊戲故事人物眾多，陣營關係多變，讓實況主在享受劇情的同時也感到些許混亂。

## 精彩時刻
- **傳神的縮圖標題：** 聊天室觀眾留言「這個戰役會讓你崩潰」，Hera 立刻表示：「這就是影片縮圖了！」
- **僧侶的生與死：** Hera 發起投票讓觀眾決定是否處決僧侶，結果「赦免」勝出，並證實是正確選擇，讓他驚訝不已。
- **曹操的黑暗面：** 第一個任務結束後，動畫揭示曹操因多疑而錯殺了款待自己的恩人全家，並說出名言：「寧我負人，毋人負我」。Hera 的反應是：「我竟然是扮演這個傢伙？」
- **名字之亂：** Hera 因發音相近的中文人名（如呂布、劉備、荀攸）而感到困惑，並開玩笑地稱自己是「種族主義者」。
- **對歷史的吐槽：** 在談到董卓與呂布為女人反目時，他評論道：「人類歷史上總是同樣的問題，男人為同一個女人爭風吃醋，然後為此大開殺戒。」

# Pro Player Tackles the Three Kingdoms Legendary Campaign

## TL;DR
Professional Age of Empires II player Hera dives into the new Three Kingdoms (Cao Cao) campaign for the first time on Legendary difficulty. He navigates the game by letting his chat make key decisions, comically struggles with the Chinese names, and is shocked to discover the dark, ruthless nature of the protagonist he's playing.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** Hera decides to take a break from competitive play to stream a campaign for his audience. Torn between nostalgia and new content, he's egged on by his chat to try the new Three Kingdoms campaign as Cao Cao on "Legendary" difficulty.
- **Middle:** He successfully completes the first two missions. First, he crushes the Yellow Turban rebels, using a chat poll to spare a group of monks which turns out to be a great strategic move. He then moves against the tyrant Dong Zhuo, again letting his chat choose a hero for him, and navigates a complex web of alliances and betrayals to emerge victorious.
- **End:** The video concludes as he begins the third mission, where he must now fight his former friend, Yuan Shao. A cutscene reveals Cao Cao's brutal philosophy, "I would rather betray the world than have the world betray me," leaving Hera stunned by the character he's playing.

## Key Insights
- **Interactive Storytelling:** Player decisions, like sparing the monks, have tangible in-game consequences and rewards.
- **Portrayal of a Warlord:** The narrative depicts Cao Cao as a brilliant but ruthless and paranoid figure, willing to commit atrocities for power, which comes as a surprise to the streamer.
- **Legendary Difficulty Experience:** For a top-tier player, the Legendary difficulty is challenging but manageable by employing aggressive tactics and exploiting powerful hero abilities.
- **The Fun of Audience Interaction:** The streamer's engagement with his chat, particularly using polls for in-game decisions, is a core part of the entertainment.
- **Complex Historical Narrative:** The game's story is filled with numerous characters and shifting alliances, which the streamer finds both engaging and confusing.

## Notable Moments
- **The Perfect Thumbnail:** A chatter comments, "This campaign will break you," and Hera immediately responds, "That's the thumbnail right there."
- **The Monk Poll:** Hera lets the chat vote on whether to spare or execute a group of monks. "Spare" wins, and it proves to be the correct choice, much to Hera's amazement.
- **Cao Cao's Dark Side:** A post-mission cutscene shows Cao Cao murdering an entire family in a fit of paranoia, leading to his infamous quote: "I would rather betray the world than have the world betray me." Hera's shocked reaction: "I'm playing as this guy."
- **Name Confusion:** Hera gets comically confused by the similar-sounding Chinese names (Lubu, Liu Bei, Xun Yu), jokingly calling himself "racist."
- **Commentary on History:** Discussing Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu fighting over a woman, he remarks, "It's always been the same problem. It's just men who want the same woman and then they just kill each other over it."
