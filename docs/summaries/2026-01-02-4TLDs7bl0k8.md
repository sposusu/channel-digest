# 與 Gamer Legion 分道揚鑣

## 重點摘要
講者宣布他將在兩年後離開電競隊伍 Gamer Legion。他回顧了這段期間的正面體驗、個人成長與挑戰，同時感謝了團隊組織與隊友們，並表示儘管困難重重，這仍是正確的決定。他對自己的未來和《世紀帝國2》的電競圈保持樂觀。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片開頭直接宣布，他將離開 Gamer Legion (GL) 組織及其《世紀帝國2》戰隊，不再與 Viper、Tado 和 Doubt 等隊友共事。他希望藉此影片分享自己的觀點、回顧這兩年的經歷並誠摯感謝 GL。
- **中段**：他首先感謝 GL 對《世紀帝國2》社群的巨大貢獻，包括舉辦了 NAC5 等大型賽事和製作了如《Town Center》播客等優質內容。他分享了最美好的時刻，特別是與隊友 Doubt 在幾乎沒有練習的情況下贏得冠軍，以及參加 Red Bull 集訓營的愉快經歷。同時，他也坦承了挑戰，包括與隊友因年齡差距和人生階段不同（如已為人父）導致目標不一致、因時區差異難以共同練習，以及剛加入時因取代了舊成員而承受的心理壓力和觀眾評論（認為他「不合群」或隊伍「過於強大」）帶來的困擾。
- **結尾**：他總結道，儘管有這些掙扎，但加入 GL 是一個讓他走出舒適圈並獲得巨大個人成長的正確決定。他感謝隊友們，並預告自己即使暫無組織支持，也已準備好迎接未來，並將在隔天發布一個與 Red Bull 相關的驚喜項目。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **挑戰是成長的催化劑**：將自己置於不熟悉的環境中（例如加入一個已成立許久的團隊），雖然會帶來壓力，但也是個人成長最快的方式。
2.  **團隊協同的複雜性**：職業團隊的成功不僅關乎技術，更受年齡差距、人生優先順序和時區等現實因素的深刻影響。
3.  **社群回饋的雙面刃**：觀眾的評論雖然有時一針見血，但也可能給選手帶來巨大的心理壓力，影響其歸屬感和決策信心。
4.  **組織對電競生態的貢獻**：Gamer Legion 透過舉辦賽事和創作內容，不僅為選手提供了舞台，也極大地豐富了整個遊戲社群的觀賽體驗。
5.  **天生的默契無價**：與隊友 Doubt 在極少練習下贏得冠軍的經驗，證明了有時選手之間的化學反應和即時的策略溝通，比長時間的制式訓練更為關鍵。

## 精彩時刻
- 在談到與 Doubt 贏得冠軍時：「我無法想像在 2025 這重要的一年能和 Doubt 一起贏得一個冠軍。」
- 回顧這兩年：「這段路或許不全然順遂… 但最終，我認為我們為粉絲和觀眾創造了難忘的兩年。」
- 坦然面對觀眾的評論：「也許觀眾是對的… 也許我從未真正融入過。」
- 關於與粉絲互動的體悟：「這件事遠比我最初想像的要重要得多。」

# Parting Ways with Gamer Legion

## TL;DR
The speaker announces his departure from the Gamer Legion esports team after two years. He reflects on the positive experiences, personal growth, and challenges faced, thanking the organization and his teammates and concluding it was the right decision despite the difficulties. He remains optimistic about his future and the Age of Empires 2 scene.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The video starts with the direct announcement that he is leaving the Gamer Legion (GL) organization and its esports team, and will no longer be teaming with fellow players Viper, Tado, and Doubt. He states the video's purpose is to share his perspective, recap the 2-year experience, and give a huge thank you to GL.
- **Middle**: He first thanks Gamer Legion for its immense contributions to the AoE2 community, such as running major S-tier tournaments like NAC5 and creating quality content like the Town Center podcast. He shares his best moments, highlighting winning a tournament with Doubt with almost no practice and the enjoyable Red Bull boot camp. He also frankly discusses the cons: the age gap and differing life priorities with teammates (e.g., being fathers) leading to a mismatch in focus, time zone issues hindering practice, and the emotional stress from how the team was formed (replacing former members) and subsequent viewer comments about him "not fitting in" or the team being "overpowered."
- **End**: He concludes that despite these struggles, joining GL was the "absolute correct choice" for his personal growth by pushing him out of his comfort zone. He thanks his teammates and looks toward the future, teasing a new Red Bull-themed surprise project for the next day and affirming his commitment to the scene even without an organization behind him.

## Key Insights
1.  **Challenges Catalyze Growth**: Putting yourself in uncomfortable environments, like joining a pre-existing group of friends, is stressful but offers the greatest opportunity for personal development in the shortest amount of time.
2.  **The Complexity of Team Synergy**: Professional team dynamics are deeply affected by real-world factors like age gaps, life priorities, and time zones, not just in-game skill.
3.  **The Double-Edged Sword of Community Feedback**: Viewer comments, while sometimes accurate, can create significant mental and emotional stress for players, affecting their sense of belonging and confidence.
4.  **An Organization's Impact on an Ecosystem**: Gamer Legion played a big role in elevating the entire AoE2 competitive scene through well-organized tournaments and high-quality content that connected fans with players.
5.  **Innate Synergy is Priceless**: Winning a major tournament with his teammate Doubt with very little practice proved that sometimes, the chemistry and on-the-fly communication between players can be more critical than extensive, rigid preparation.

## Notable Moments
- On winning a tournament with Doubt: "I couldn't imagine winning a tournament with doubt in the big year of 2025."
- Reflecting on the two years: "It might not have been the smoothest ride... but in the end, I think that, you know, we created a memorable two years for the for the fans and the viewers."
- On facing viewer criticism: "maybe the viewers were right... maybe I just never really fit in."
- On the importance of meeting fans: It ended up being "a lot more important than I thought it would ever be."
