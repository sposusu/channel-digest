# 世紀帝國2：在新地圖「運河」上用喬治亞混合戰術取勝

## 重點摘要
玩家在地圖「運河」上使用喬治亞文明，執行了一套先陸後水的混合戰術。他前期利用防禦塔穩住陣腳，進入城堡時代後，便以強大的戰船控制中央水道，配合前線塔攻與騎士的騷擾，成功摧毀對手基地，贏得一場漂亮的勝利。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 玩家選擇喬治亞文明，目標是快速建立碼頭以利用岸邊漁獲。他的計畫並非在封建時代爭奪水權，而是先在陸上施壓。他雖然因失誤損失了斥候，但成功地用火船與防禦箭塔化解了對手的早期攻勢，並保護了自己的經濟。
- **中段：** 進入城堡時代後，玩家立刻執行核心計畫：升級戰船並主宰中央水道。他利用制水權發動了毀滅性的前線塔攻，並派出騎士支援，同時他的戰船開始猛烈砲轟對手緊鄰水邊的城鎮中心。
- **結尾：** 在戰船與箭塔的雙重壓力下，對手無力回天。對手的反擊被輕易化解，最終迅速投降（打出GG）。遊戲結束後，玩家讚揚了這張地圖的戰術深度，並鼓勵觀眾親自嘗試。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **城堡時代的水權是關鍵：** 在「運河」地圖上，由於城鎮中心緊鄰岸邊，能在城堡時代控制水道是致勝的絕對優勢。
2.  **混合戰術優於單一策略：** 比起開局就全力投入海軍，先穩固陸地經濟，能為城堡時代的水上總攻奠定更堅實的基礎。
3.  **防禦性塔攻的價值：** 在自家資源點旁建造防禦箭塔，能有效化解封建時代的騷擾（如弓兵），為升級城堡時代爭取寶貴時間。
4.  **喬治亞文明的適性：** 喬治亞因其快速碼頭的潛力與多元的戰術選擇，非常適合這張需要靈活應對的混合型地圖。
5.  **多點進攻的威力：** 結合水上戰船的砲轟、陸上騎士的騷擾以及前線塔攻的壓迫，能形成令對手難以應對的多重威脅。

## 精彩時刻
- 玩家在損失斥候後幽默地自嘲：「斥候死了就不能回血了。Hera，你在幹嘛？... 我就是個專挑別人錯的『糾察隊』，活該損失。」
- 看到對手單位衝進他的控制區時，他自信地說：「我的老兄，你在做什麼？... 這是違法的。讓我來懲罰他們。」
- 對於遊戲樂趣的總結：「贏然是好玩。但撇開輸贏，這場遊戲本身就很有趣，因為我有很多不同的決策可以選擇。」

# Age of Empires II: Winning on the New "Canals" Map with a Georgian Hybrid Strategy

## TL;DR
The player uses the Georgians on the "Canals" map, executing a land-then-sea hybrid strategy. After securing his economy with defensive towers, he dominates the central waterway in Castle Age with powerful War Galleys, combining them with a forward tower rush and knights to decisively crush his opponent's base.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The player starts as Georgians, aiming for a fast dock to utilize shore fish. His plan is not to win the water in Feudal Age, but to apply land pressure first. Despite losing his scout to a mistake, he successfully defends against the opponent's early aggression using fire ships and defensive towers to protect his economy.
- **Middle:** Upon reaching Castle Age, the player immediately executes his core plan: upgrading to War Galleys and seizing control of the central waterway. He leverages his water dominance to launch a devastating forward tower rush supported by knights, while his galleys begin bombarding the opponent's vulnerable waterside Town Center.
- **End:** The combined pressure from the galleys and forward towers proves unstoppable. The opponent's attempts to counter are easily shut down, leading to a quick resignation (GG). The player then praises the map's strategic depth and encourages viewers to try it themselves.

## Key Insights
1.  **Castle Age Water Control is Key:** On the "Canals" map, controlling the water in Castle Age is a game-winning advantage due to the proximity of Town Centers to the shore.
2.  **Hybrid Strategy Over All-In:** A hybrid approach is more effective than committing fully to navy from the start. Securing your land and economy first provides a stronger foundation for a Castle Age water push.
3.  **The Value of Defensive Towers:** Building defensive towers near your resources can effectively neutralize Feudal Age harassment (like archers) and buy crucial time to advance to Castle Age.
4.  **Georgians' Suitability:** The Georgians are a strong choice for this map due to their fast dock potential and versatile strategic options, making them ideal for a flexible hybrid map.
5.  **The Power of Multi-Pronged Attacks:** Combining the bombardment from War Galleys, harassment from knights on land, and pressure from forward towers creates multiple threats that are overwhelming to defend against.

## Notable Moments
- The player humorously calls himself out after losing his scout: "You can't heal if the scout dies. Hera, what are you doing? ... I was being a mistake Karen. I deserve to lose that one."
- His confident reaction to the opponent's units running into his controlled area: "My brother, what are you doing? ... That is illegal. Let me punish them."
- His concluding thought on why the game was fun beyond just winning: "Winning does equal fun. But I will say winning aside, this was still a fun game because I had so many different decisions I could have went for."
