# 史詩級世紀帝國對決：T90（馬利）vs. Running（西班牙）

## 重點摘要
在一場受限於1小時15分鐘的比賽中，選手T90利用馬利文明無窮的黃金優勢，對抗控制著額外人口上限的對手Running。儘管在軍隊數量上處於劣勢，T90在遊戲後期巧妙地將策略轉向「比分勝利」，透過大量研發科技並進行有效的騷擾，最終在計時器結束時以較高積分贏得了比賽。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 遊戲以帝國戰爭模式開始，T90（馬利）選擇了標準的雙靶場開局。對手Running（西班牙）地圖非常開闊，選擇龜縮防守。T90雖然更快地升上城堡時代，但出於謹慎，他沒有立即發動攻勢，而是選擇了三城鎮中心（TC）的經濟爆發，這被認為是一個較為穩健的打法。

- **中段：** T90憑藉經濟優勢取得了村民領先，而Running則發動了一波單TC的騎射手總攻。T90因過於貪圖經濟發展而未及時建造防禦性的攻城武器所，導致其經濟被嚴重騷擾。儘管基地受損，T90仍成功在前線建立城堡，確保了關鍵的黃金資源。此時，Running控制了地圖上提供+25人口上限的紀念碑，而T90則坐擁地圖下方幾乎無限的黃金。

- **結尾：** 隨著比賽接近1小時15分的時限，勝負將由分數決定。Running利用人口優勢集結了一支龐大的軍隊，但T90意識到正面衝突難以取勝，於是轉變策略。他開始瘋狂花費他數千的黃金儲備，研發所有能提升分數的科技（甚至包括「異端邪說」），同時利用其黃金兵種不斷進行騷擾。Running被迫在高風險的進攻中消耗部隊，反而為T90增加了擊殺分數。計時器結束時，T90憑藉著巨大的分數優勢獲勝。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **變通的勝利條件：** 在有時間限制的比賽中，除了軍事征服，「比分」本身就是一個可行的勝利途徑。
2.  **經濟力 vs. 人口上限：** 這場比賽完美展示了近乎無限的黃金供應（T90）與額外25人口上限（Running）之間的經典對決。
3.  **科技對分數的價值：** 在遊戲後期，研發科技（即使是非核心升級）能提供巨大的分數加成，足以決定一場計時比賽的勝負。
4.  **宏觀營運與騷擾：** T90出色的多線操作與持續的騷擾，使Running無法完全發揮其225人口大軍的優勢。
5.  **適應性的重要：** T90從早期的冒險打法，到中期根據局勢轉換兵種（駱駝），再到最後完全改變勝利條件（轉為比分取勝），展現了頂級玩家的靈活性。

## 精彩時刻
- 主播反覆驚嘆T90的冒險風格：「我從沒想過他是這麼愛冒險的玩家。」
- 在T90銀行存款超過7000黃金時，主播大喊：「花掉它，兄弟！人生苦短，及時行樂！」
- T90研發「異端邪說」（Heresy）科技的瞬間，分數立即飆升250分，證實了他的「比分勝利」策略。
- T90一座前線城堡在被摧毀前，創下了64次擊殺的驚人紀錄，贏得了聊天室的「致敬」。
- 主播賽後分析指出，T90如果早期打得更穩健防守，本可以更輕鬆地贏得比賽。

# Epic AoE2 Match: T90 (Malians) vs. Running (Spanish)

## TL;DR
In a match capped at a 1 hour and 15-minute time limit, T90 leveraged the Malian civilization's immense gold advantage against Running, who controlled an extra population cap. Despite facing a numerically superior army, T90 strategically pivoted to a "score victory" in the late game by mass-researching technologies and executing effective harassment, securing the win by points when the timer expired.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The game began in Empire Wars mode. T90 (Malians) opted for a standard two-range opening. His opponent, Running (Spanish), had a very open map and chose to wall up defensively. Although T90 reached the Castle Age faster, he played cautiously, opting for a three-Town Center economic boom instead of immediate aggression, a move noted as safe and solid.

- **Middle:** T90's boom gave him a villager lead, while Running committed to a one-TC all-in with cavalry archers. T90 was criticized for being greedy with economic upgrades instead of building a defensive siege workshop, leading to his economy being heavily raided. Despite the damage, T90 established a forward castle to secure crucial gold. At this stage, Running controlled the map's monument for +25 population, while T90 controlled the nearly infinite gold at the bottom of the map.

- **End:** As the game neared the 1h 15m time limit, victory would be decided by score. Running amassed a massive army with his population advantage, but T90 realized a head-on fight was unwinnable and switched strategies. He began spending his thousands in banked gold to research every technology possible for score (even "Heresy"), while constantly harassing with his gold units. Running was forced into costly engagements, which ironically gave T90 more score from kills. When the timer ended, T90 won with a commanding score lead.

## Key Insights
1.  **Alternative Win Conditions:** In timed matches, score itself can be a viable path to victory, not just military annihilation.
2.  **Economic Power vs. Population Space:** The game was a classic struggle between T90's near-infinite gold supply and Running's +25 population advantage from the map monument.
3.  **The Value of Technology for Score:** Late-game tech research, even for non-essential upgrades, provides a significant score boost that can be the deciding factor in a timed game.
4.  **Macro Management and Harassment:** T90's excellent macro, enabling him to fight on multiple fronts, prevented Running from ever fully leveraging his 225-population army.
5.  **Adaptability is Key:** T90 demonstrated top-tier flexibility by shifting from a risky early style, to adapting his unit composition mid-game (to camels), and finally changing his entire win condition to score.

## Notable Moments
- The caster repeatedly calling out T90's risky plays, saying, "I didn't take him for such a risky player."
- The caster yelling at T90 to "spend it, brother!" when he had over 7,000 gold in the bank, comparing him to a dying man with a year to live who is still saving money.
- The "Heresy" technology purchase, which gave a massive, visible +250 score spike, confirming T90's score-play strategy.
- One of T90's forward castles racking up an incredible 64 kills before finally being destroyed, earning "Salutes in the chat."
- The caster's post-game analysis that T90 made the game much harder than it needed to be by not playing more defensively in the early-mid game.
