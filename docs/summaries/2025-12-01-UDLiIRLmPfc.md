# Hera的世紀帝國2：高風險高回報的戰象天蠍海！

## 重點摘要
職業選手 Hera 在一場《世紀帝國2》對戰中，採用了高風險的「戰象 + 天蠍」組合。儘管早期犯下失誤、一度處於劣勢，但他最終憑藉這支勢不可擋的軍隊壓垮了對手，贏得了一場極具娛樂性的勝利。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：Hera 選擇高棉文明，打算應觀眾要求使用戰象策略。在遊戲初期，他與聊天室觀眾閒聊，話題從電競世界盃（EWC）聊到他對喬丹·彼得森的看法，認為他「變成了自己曾警告大家不要成為的那種人」。
- **中段**：他決定採用雙攻城器製造所的「天蠍」配上「戰象」的強力推進戰術。遊戲過程中，他因一個重大失誤，損失了所有前線的天蠍，使戰術陷入極大風險。期間，他也分享了自己的人生觀（做自己喜歡的事遠比賺錢重要）和對居住地的偏好（討厭寒冷，熱愛南美）。
- **結尾**：儘管處於劣勢，Hera 依然堅持執行戰術，集結了龐大的戰象軍團。由於遊戲更新後戰象擁有了更高的抗招降能力，它們如「活的衝車」般勢不可擋，直接摧毀了多出 30 個村民的對手基地，迫使對方打出「GG」。Hera 對這個有趣又強大的戰術感到非常滿意。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **戰術的威力**：高棉的「戰象 + 天蠍」組合是一個強大的後期戰術，一旦成形，其推進力量足以扭轉戰局，即使在經濟落後時也能取勝。
2.  **遊戲機制的影響**：遊戲的更新（如戰象的抗招降能力提升）讓一些舊的或冷門的戰術重新變得可行且極具威脅性。
3.  **熱情勝於金錢**：Hera 強調，他的人生哲學是追隨自己的熱情。他選擇電競這條路時幾乎沒有收入，做自己喜歡的事對他而言是最重要的。
4.  **職業選手也會犯錯**：即使是頂尖選手也會犯下嚴重失誤（如損失所有天蠍），但堅持既定戰略並憑藉強大的執行力，依然能夠贏得比賽。
5.  **幽默是最好的調劑**：Hera 在直播中穿插了大量幽默的自嘲和玩笑，例如他對阿根廷治安的玩笑，這不僅娛樂了觀眾，也展現了他的個人魅力。

## 精彩時刻
- 他開玩笑說在阿根廷三年見過的唯一犯罪，就是「我持槍搶劫店主那次」。
- 他的剪輯師 K1 嘗試了新風格，結果被觀眾稱讚為「超讚的新剪輯師」，讓他覺得非常搞笑。
- 他對喬丹·彼得森的評價：「他變成了自己曾警告大家不要成為的那種人。」
- 在最後的總攻中，他興奮地喊道：「戰象就是我的衝車！」看著大象軍團吞噬了對手的基地。
- 最終獲勝時的滿足感：「這太好玩了！我好久沒用這種戰術打得這麼爽了。」

# Hera's AoE2: The High-Risk, High-Reward Elephant & Scorpion Push!

## TL;DR
Pro player Hera commits to a risky Khmer "Battle Elephant + Scorpion" composition in an Age of Empires II match. Despite an early blunder that put him at a disadvantage, he ultimately amassed an unstoppable army that crushed his opponent for a highly entertaining win.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: Hera starts a game as the Khmer, intending to use a battle elephant strategy at a viewer's request. During the early game, he banters with his chat about topics ranging from the Esports World Cup (EWC) to his opinion on Jordan Peterson, whom he feels "became the man he warned not to become."
- **Middle**: He decides on a powerful push using Scorpions from two Siege Workshops combined with Battle Elephants. He suffers a major setback when he loses all his forward Scorpions to a raid, putting his strategy in jeopardy. During this time, he also discusses his life philosophy (doing what you love is more important than money) and location preferences (hates the cold, loves South America).
- **End**: Despite being behind, Hera commits to the strategy and masses a huge force of Battle Elephants. Thanks to a game update giving them conversion resistance, the elephants act as "living rams," proving unstoppable. They steamroll the opponent's base, who had 30 more villagers, forcing a "GG." Hera is immensely satisfied with the fun and powerful outcome.

## Key Insights
1.  **Strategy's Power**: The Khmer "Elephant + Scorpion" composition is a formidable late-game push that, once assembled, can turn the tide and win even from an economic deficit.
2.  **Impact of Game Mechanics**: Game updates, like increased conversion resistance for elephants, can make old or niche strategies viable and highly threatening again.
3.  **Passion Over Paycheck**: Hera emphasizes his life philosophy is to follow his passion. He chose his path in esports when he was making almost no money, showing that personal fulfillment is his priority.
4.  **Pros Make Mistakes Too**: Even top players can make critical errors (like losing all his siege), but resilience and commitment to a strong game plan can still lead to victory.
5.  **Humor as a Key Ingredient**: Hera's stream is filled with self-deprecating humor and jokes, such as his quip about crime in Argentina, which entertains his audience and showcases his personality.

## Notable Moments
- His deadpan joke that the only crime he saw in three years in Argentina was "when I robbed that store owner at gunpoint."
- The anecdote about his editor, K1, being praised as a "sick new editor" when it was just him trying a new style, which Hera found hilarious.
- His concise critique of Jordan Peterson: "He became the man he warned not to become."
- His triumphant declaration during the final push: "The elephants are my rams!" as his army devoured the enemy base.
- His satisfaction after the win: "That was so satisfying. I haven't played with this kind of strat in so long. I love it."
