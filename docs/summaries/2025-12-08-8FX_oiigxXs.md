# 世紀帝國II回放分析：Cats Not Dog (1100 Elo)

## 重點摘要
玩家開局基礎不錯，但在遊戲中期因戰術混亂、混合使用未升級的單位而犯下致命錯誤。致勝和進步的關鍵在於簡化戰術，專注於掌握控兵、升級等基礎，並避免無效的資源分配。

## 故事大綱
- 開場：分析始於玩家的黑暗時代。前期偵查做得很好，但因建築順序效率不彰（升級時代太慢、過早蓋第二磨坊）和村民閒置時間而受到批評。
- 中段：玩家進入封建時代，嘗試斥侯快攻。評論者讚賞這個想法，但嚴厲批評其執行力，特別是因控兵不佳而無法擊殺村民。遊戲進入城堡時代後戰術變得混亂，結合了全力進攻（四馬廄）和經濟擴張（新城鎮中心）這兩種矛盾的策略，經濟平衡也失調（木材過多），一次冒險的前置城堡更差點輸掉比賽。
- 結尾：儘管擁有巨大的資源優勢，玩家卻因軍隊組成效率低下而節節敗退。評論者建議簡化後期戰術：專注於全副升級的弩兵和重裝駱駝。玩家最終集結了一支更強大的軍隊，點了關鍵科技，贏下一場決定性的戰鬥，成功翻盤。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **效率為王**：微小的低效率，如村民的步行時間，會積少成多，抵銷經濟優勢。
2.  **精通控兵以確保擊殺**：斥侯快攻時，僅僅右鍵點擊是不夠的。學會移動到村民身後「卡位」攻擊，是確保擊殺的關鍵。
3.  **制定清晰一致的戰術**：不要混合矛盾的計畫，例如全力一搏的馬廄爆兵和開新城鎮中心的龜縮經濟。
4.  **升級優於多樣性**：少量全副升級的單位，遠勝於一支未升級的混合部隊。近戰單位應優先升級防禦。
5.  **簡化以求進步**：在較低水平，提升的最佳方式是完善一個簡單而強大的戰術（如城堡時代全力爆騎士），而不是嘗試複雜的兵種轉換。

## 精彩時刻
- 評論者傳授的「職業玩家」技巧，用斥侯擊殺村民：「跑過村民，當你在他頭上時再點擊攻擊，然後跟著他。」
- 玩家蓋了四座馬廄準備「全力一搏」，評論者才剛稱讚，她馬上蓋了一座新的城鎮中心，讓戰術變得矛盾：「天啊，我才說全力一搏，妳直接提升到新境界了...喔，突然間我們沒法全力進攻了。」
- 玩家研發了「卡曼達蘭」（讓弩兵免黃金），卻沒有相對應的升級、科技或資源來支撐弓兵轉型，讓評論者不禁問：「為什麼？妳當下到底在想什麼？」
- 最終的翻盤：儘管中期一團亂，甚至在資源領先八千時還在輸，玩家最終簡化了軍隊，補齊升級，並贏得一場關鍵的上坡戰鬥。

# Age of Empires II Replay Analysis: Cats Not Dog (1100 Elo)

## TL;DR
The player has a solid foundational start but makes critical mid-game errors with a confused strategy and a mix of un-upgraded units. The key to winning and improving is to simplify strategy, focus on mastering fundamentals like unit micro and getting upgrades, and avoid inefficient resource allocation.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The analysis starts with the player's Dark Age. The initial scouting is praised, but it's criticized for an inefficient build order (a slow uptime, an unnecessary second mill) and villager idle time.
- **Middle:** The player enters the Feudal Age and attempts a scout rush. The reviewer praises the idea but heavily criticizes the execution, specifically the inability to kill villagers due to poor micro. The transition to Castle Age is messy, combining a contradictory strategy of an all-in (four stables) and an economic boom (a new Town Center), with poor economic balance (too much wood) and a risky forward castle that almost loses the game.
- **End:** Despite a massive resource lead, the player is losing fights due to an inefficient army composition. The reviewer advises a simplified late-game plan: focus on fully upgraded crossbows and heavy camels. The player eventually masses a stronger army, gets key technologies, and wins a decisive battle to secure a comeback victory.

## Key Insights
1.  **Efficiency is King:** Small inefficiencies, like villager walking time, accumulate and can negate economic bonuses.
2.  **Master Micro for Kills:** In a scout rush, simply right-clicking is not enough. Learning to "trap" villagers by moving past them is crucial for securing kills.
3.  **Have a Clear, Coherent Strategy:** Don't mix contradictory plans, like a 4-stable all-in and booming with a new Town Center.
4.  **Upgrades Over Variety:** A few types of fully upgraded units are far more effective than a mixed army of un-upgraded ones. Prioritize armor for melee units.
5.  **Simplify to Improve:** At lower levels, the best way to get better is to perfect a simple, strong strategy (e.g., all-in knights in Castle Age) rather than attempting complex unit transitions.

## Notable Moments
- The reviewer's "pro-player" trick for killing villagers with scouts: "run through the vill, right click it once when you're on top of it and then follow it."
- The player builds four stables for an "all-in," which the reviewer praises, only to immediately build a new TC, confusing the strategy: "Damn, I said all in. You took it to the next level... Oh, all of a sudden we can't put the all in anymore."
- The moment the player researches "Kamandaran" (making crossbows cost no gold) without the upgrades, tech, or resources to support an archer switch, prompting the reviewer to ask: "like why, like what what are you thinking in that moment?"
- The final comeback: Despite mid-game disasters and being 8,000 resources ahead but still losing, the player simplifies their army, gets upgrades, and wins a key uphill battle.
