# 世紀帝國II：拜占庭垃圾兵對決韃靼

## 重點摘要
玩家使用拜占庭文明，採取極具侵略性的前置快攻，利用大量廉價的矛兵與戰矛兵（俗稱「垃圾兵」）壓垮對手。這場勝利的關鍵在於成功阻止了對手建造防禦城堡，並在僅剩8滴血時將其摧毀，展示了以量取勝的經典戰術。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：玩家選擇拜占庭對抗韃靼，認為這是一個不錯的對局。他很快就決定不走常規開局，而是要嘗試一些「好玩的」，即前置（Forward）對手，在敵人家附近直接蓋兵營施壓。
- **中段**：玩家在對手基地附近放下雙兵營和靶場，開始大量生產矛兵和戰矛兵。他利用便宜的單位數量優勢不斷騷擾、進攻。對手試圖用騎兵單位反擊，但玩家利用小山丘的地形優勢和壓倒性的部隊數量贏得了關鍵戰鬥。
- **結尾**：對手在高地上放下城堡意圖穩住局勢，這成為遊戲的轉捩點。玩家集結所有部隊，瘋狂攻擊建造中的城堡。在一場驚心動魄的攻防戰後，他在城堡僅剩 8 HP 的情況下成功摧毀它，徹底粉碎了對手的防線，贏得了比賽。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **拜占庭的垃圾兵海是可行的**：即使在高手對局中，拜占庭依靠其打折單位，用純粹的「垃圾兵」（不耗黃金的單位）進行全軍出擊（all-in）依然是個非常強大的策略。
2.  **前置施壓能有效打亂節奏**：開局就將戰線推到對手家門口，可以有效打擊其經濟、限制其發展，並迫使他做出被動反應。
3.  **阻止關鍵建築是致勝關鍵**：這場對局的勝負手就在於是否能阻止對手的城堡蓋起來。成功摧毀城堡不僅消除了防禦威脅，也重創了對手的經濟和士氣。
4.  **地形優勢極為重要**：玩家充分利用了山丘，讓他的遠程單位（戰矛兵）在攻擊時獲得巨大優勢，這是多次交戰獲勝的重要因素。
5.  **數量可以彌補質量**：雖然對手的單位更精銳，但拜占庭的部隊源源不絕，憑藉數量優勢和持續的攻擊，最終壓垮了質量更高的敵人。

## 精彩時刻
- **「我要搞點前置」**：遊戲初期，玩家放棄安穩發展，興致勃勃地決定要在對手家門口蓋房子，開啟了整場的侵略性打法。
- **城堡驚險攻防戰**：最精彩的部分莫過於最後的城堡攻防。城堡只剩 8 HP，對手村民全部上前修理，但玩家的矛兵硬是卡住所有村民，成功拆掉了城堡，場面極度緊張刺激。
- **玩家的賽後感言**：他總結這是一場非常有趣的對局，這種「垃圾兵海」戰術很經典，非常適合休閒玩家，並決定將這場比賽上傳到 YouTube。

# Age of Empires II: Byzantine Trash Spam vs. Tatars

## TL;DR
The player uses the Byzantine civilization to execute a highly aggressive forward-rush, overwhelming their opponent with a massive army of cheap Pikemen and Skirmishers ("trash units"). The victory was secured by narrowly destroying a critical defensive castle with just 8 HP remaining, showcasing a classic quantity-over-quality strategy.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The player, facing the Tatars as the Byzantines, decides against a standard opening. He opts for something "fun": a "forward" strategy, building military buildings right next to the enemy's base to apply immediate pressure.
- **Middle**: The player builds double barracks and a range near the opponent's town, spamming a constant stream of spearmen and skirmishers. He uses the sheer number of these cheap units to relentlessly harass and attack. The opponent attempts to counter with cavalry, but the player leverages a hill advantage and overwhelming numbers to win key engagements.
- **End**: The turning point of the game comes when the opponent tries to build a defensive castle on high ground. The player throws his entire army at the foundation. After a thrilling battle, he manages to destroy the castle with only 8 HP left, shattering the opponent's defensive hopes and winning the game.

## Key Insights
1.  **Byzantine Trash Spam is Viable**: Even at a high level, a Byzantine all-in strategy relying purely on its discounted "trash units" (which don't cost gold) is incredibly powerful.
2.  **Forward Pressure Disrupts Rhythm**: Pushing the front line to the opponent's doorstep from the start effectively disrupts their economy, limits their options, and forces them into a reactive, defensive posture.
3.  **Denying Key Buildings is Decisive**: The entire match hinged on stopping the enemy castle from going up. Successfully destroying it not only removed a major defensive threat but also crushed the opponent's economy and morale.
4.  **Terrain Advantage is Crucial**: The player made excellent use of a hill, giving his ranged Skirmishers a significant attack bonus that was instrumental in winning several fights.
5.  **Quantity Can Overcome Quality**: Although the opponent's units were individually stronger, the relentless flood of Byzantine units, thanks to their continuous production, eventually overwhelmed the higher-quality but less numerous army.

## Notable Moments
- **"I might try some forward"**: Early in the game, the player excitedly ditches a safe-and-steady approach to go for the aggressive forward-rush that defines the match.
- **The 8 HP Castle Denial**: The most exciting moment was the final siege on the castle. With just 8 HP remaining and the opponent's villagers swarming to repair it, the player's Pikes managed to block them all and tear down the structure in a nail-biting finish.
- **The Post-Game Reflection**: The player concludes that it was a "really fun" game and that the "trash spam" strategy is a classic that's very enjoyable for casual players, deciding it's perfect content to showcase on YouTube.
