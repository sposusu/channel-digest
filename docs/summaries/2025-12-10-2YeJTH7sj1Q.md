# 《世紀帝國2》新手為何痛苦？對玩家入門體驗的深度剖析

## 重點摘要
影片主講人指出，《世紀帝國2》的新手玩家正因為糟糕的入門體驗而備受挫折。從該選擇哪個遊戲版本、缺乏引導的遊戲初期、到過於困難的排位賽環境和遊戲內社交功能的缺失，這些問題共同導致新玩家難以融入，對遊戲的長期發展構成威脅。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：主講人發現他的頻道湧入許多新手，他們總是提出類似的、充滿困惑的問題。他意識到這是一個普遍現象，即新手玩家在入門時正經歷著同樣的痛苦。
- **中段**：他詳細闡述了幾個核心問題：
    1.  **版本混淆**：新手不知道該買聽起來不錯的「HD 版」還是「決定版（Definitive Edition）」。
    2.  **內容轟炸**：進入遊戲後，幾乎所有文明都已解鎖，沒有漸進式的教學或解鎖系統來引導玩家，導致新手不知從何下手，最常見的問題便是「哪個文明適合新手？」
    3.  **排位賽門檻過高**：這是最嚴重的問題。現在的 1000 ELO 玩家水準遠高於幾年前，導致新手一進入排位賽就會被連續擊敗。加上「小號（Smurfing）」問題，體驗極差。
    4.  **替代方案糟糕**：排位賽之外的「快速遊戲」配對不均，「大廳列表」則充滿錯誤、標示不清且難以使用，被他稱為「遊戲中最爛的東西」。
    5.  **社交孤立**：遊戲內沒有好友系統、私訊或語音聊天，玩家無法在遊戲中建立聯繫，必須依賴 Discord 等第三方平台。
- **結尾**：主講人總結，這些問題共同為新手創造了非常糟糕的初次體驗，許多人因此放棄。他認為改善新手引導對遊戲的未來至關重要，並邀請觀眾分享自己的看法與解決方案。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **入門門檻令人卻步**：從購買遊戲版本到選擇第一個文明，整個過程缺乏清晰指引，讓新手感到混亂。
2.  **排位賽對新手極不友善**：玩家平均技術水準已大幅提升，使得預設的起始積分（ELO）對真正的初學者來說是個煉獄。
3.  **缺乏漸進式學習曲線**：遊戲一次性地將所有內容丟給玩家，錯失了透過逐步解鎖來引導學習並提供成就感的機會。
4.  **遊戲內的社交孤島**：遊戲本身無法建立社交連結，諷刺地與《世紀帝國2》社群本身「非常熱情好客」的氛圍形成強烈對比。
5.  **對遊戲壽命的隱憂**：無法留住新血，對遊戲社群的長期健康和成長是一個重大的潛在危機。

## 精彩時刻
- 「現在的 1000 ELO 玩家，水準大概相當於幾年前的 1500 ELO。」—— 精準點出玩家技術膨脹的現象。
- 「大廳系統是我們遊戲裡最爛的東西，沒有之一。」—— 對糟糕功能不加掩飾的批評。
- 借鏡 chess.com 的建議：讓玩家在初次進入排位賽時，可以自行選擇「新手」、「中階」或「進階」等不同的起始積分。
- 點出核心矛盾：「《世紀帝國2》的社群對新手超級友善，但遊戲本身卻對新手極度不友善。」

# Why New AoE2 Players Are Suffering: A Breakdown of the New Player Experience

## TL;DR
Age of Empires 2 is struggling to retain new players due to a deeply flawed onboarding process. Key issues include confusion over which game version to buy, an overwhelming number of initial choices with no guidance, a brutally difficult entry point into ranked play, and a lack of in-game social features, all creating a frustrating and isolated experience.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The speaker opens by sharing that many new viewers on his channel are confused and asking the same questions, leading him to realize that new AoE2 players are universally "suffering."
- **Middle**: He breaks down the core problems sequentially:
    1.  **Version Confusion**: New players are unsure whether to get the "HD Edition" or the "Definitive Edition."
    2.  **Information Overload**: Once in the game, nearly all content is unlocked, but there's no guided tutorial or progression system, leaving players overwhelmed and constantly asking "what's the best civilization for beginners?"
    3.  **Ranked is Too Hard**: The biggest issue. The average skill at the starting 1000 ELO is vastly higher than it was years ago, causing new players to get crushed repeatedly. Smurfing makes this even worse.
    4.  **Poor Alternatives**: Beyond ranked, "Quick Play" has imbalanced matchmaking, and the "Lobby System" is described as buggy, unintuitive, and "the worst thing we have in the game."
    5.  **Social Isolation**: The game has no friend system, direct messaging, or voice chat, forcing players to use third-party platforms like Discord to connect with anyone.
- **End**: He concludes that this combination of issues leads to a terrible first experience that pushes most new players away. He argues that improving this new player integration is vital for the game's future and asks the community for their thoughts and solutions.

## Key Insights
1.  **A Daunting Barrier to Entry**: From purchasing the right version to picking a first civilization, the initial process is confusing and lacks clear guidance.
2.  **Ranked Mode is Punishing for Newcomers**: The average player skill has inflated dramatically, making the default starting ELO a slaughterhouse for true beginners.
3.  **No Progressive Learning Curve**: The game dumps all its content on the player at once, missing a key opportunity to guide learning and provide a sense of reward through a gradual unlocking system.
4.  **An In-Game Social Desert**: The game itself is an isolated experience, which is ironic given that the AoE2 community is known for being "super welcoming," but you can't find them in the game.
5.  **A Threat to the Game's Longevity**: The failure to retain new players is a significant risk to the long-term health and growth of the game's community.

## Notable Moments
- "A thousand ELO of today is kind of like 1500 a few years ago." — A sharp observation on the game's skill inflation.
- "The lobby system is by far the worst thing we have in the game." — A blunt and powerful critique of a core feature.
- The proposed solution from chess.com: Allow new players to self-select a starting ELO (Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced) to ensure fairer initial matches.
- The core paradox: "The game itself is so unwelcoming to new players," even though the community outside the game is "super welcoming and super friendly."
