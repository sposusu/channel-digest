# 世紀帝國2：解析KOD沙漠王Meta — 黑快轉裝甲步兵打法

## 重點摘要
玩家示範在無猛獸的KOD沙漠王新地圖上，使用「黑快轉裝甲步兵」的策略。他透過此戰術在遊戲早期就對敵方經濟造成關鍵打擊，並將這份優勢轉化為地圖控制力，最終透過收集遺跡贏得比賽。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：玩家介紹這是一場日本（他）對決勃根地（Viper）的1v1隨機文明對戰，地圖是KOD（沙漠之王）新版阿拉伯。他解釋，由於地圖上沒有猛獸（狼、獅子），因此他要嘗試一個新興的Meta：黑暗時代民兵快攻（Drush），並在封建時代升級為裝甲步兵（Men-at-Arms）。
- **中段**：他的兩名民兵成功騷擾對手，發現對手防守有漏洞後，果斷升級裝甲步兵強攻，在對手的漿果叢旁擊殺了2-3名村民，造成了嚴重的經濟損失。對手出矛兵防守，他則靈活轉出斥侯反制，持續施加壓力並再抓到村民。
- **結尾**：玩家憑藉早期優勢率先晉級城堡時代。他預判勃根地對遺跡的需求，蓋了兩座修道院來控制地圖上的遺跡。成功收集多數遺跡後，他的經濟和戰略優勢已無法逆轉，在一次小規模交戰後，對手打出「GG」投降。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **新地圖改變Meta**：KOD新版阿拉伯地圖移除了猛獸，使得黑暗時代的步兵開局（如民兵）變得極為安全且強大，成為頂尖玩家的新寵。
2.  **靈活性是關鍵**：這個戰術的核心在於靈活。玩家先用少量民兵試探，根據觀察到的情況決定後續是升級強攻，還是轉型其他兵種，讓自己總能做出最佳應對。
3.  **早期經濟打擊定勝負**：在高水準對局中，遊戲前15分鐘造成的2-3名村民損失，就足以產生滾雪球效應，奠定整場比賽的勝基。
4.  **針對性策略**：意識到對手是勃根地（遺跡能產生黃金），玩家在城堡時代立刻轉向控制遺跡，直擊對手文明的要害，這是非常高明的戰略思維。
5.  **懲罰微小失誤**：對手僅僅是讓村民回到被攻擊過的漿果叢，這個看似自然的舉動卻成了致命失誤，被玩家抓住機會擴大戰果。

## 精彩時刻
- **噁心漿果叢的勝利**：用裝甲步兵在對手「噁心的漿果叢」旁逮到村民，玩家稱這是奠定勝局的關鍵一擊。
- **斥侯的老招**：用斥侯假裝撤退，然後瞬間回馬槍抓掉一名村民，展現了精湛的微操作。
- **雙修道院的決策**：預判到對手動向，果斷蓋出兩座修道院來「控制遺跡」，徹底封鎖了勃根地的優勢。
- **玩家的結論**：「我要說，這個新Meta現在真的太噁心了。」（This new meta is nasty right now.）

# Age of Empires 2: Mastering the New KOD 'Drush to Men-at-Arms' Meta

## TL;DR
The player demonstrates a new "Drush to Men-at-Arms" strategy on the predator-free KOD Arabia map. He uses this early aggression to deal critical economic damage, then parlays that lead into map control and secures the win by collecting relics.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The player introduces a 1v1 match as Japanese (himself) versus Burgundians (Viper) on the new KOD (King of the Desert) Arabia map. He explains his plan to use a new meta: a Dark Age militia rush (Drush) followed by a Feudal Age Men-at-Arms upgrade, a strategy made viable by the map's lack of predator animals.
- **Middle**: His two militia successfully harass the opponent. Seeing an opening in the defenses, he commits to the Men-at-Arms upgrade and attacks, killing 2-3 villagers at the enemy's berry patch and inflicting significant economic damage. He flexibly transitions into scouts to counter the opponent's skirmisher response, maintaining pressure and picking off another villager.
- **End**: With the lead from his early aggression, the player reaches the Castle Age first. Anticipating the Burgundian player's need for relics, he builds two monasteries to control them. After securing most of the relics, his strategic and economic advantage becomes insurmountable, and the opponent calls "GG" after a final skirmish.

## Key Insights
1.  **New Map, New Meta**: The removal of predators on the new KOD Arabia map makes early infantry openings (like the Drush) significantly safer and more powerful, turning it into a top-tier strategy.
2.  **Flexibility is Key**: The core of this strategy is its flexibility. The player starts with a small militia force to scout, then decides whether to press the attack or transition based on what he sees, always allowing for the optimal follow-up.
3.  **Early Damage Decides the Game**: In high-level play, the loss of just 2-3 villagers in the first 15 minutes can create a snowball effect that determines the entire match's outcome.
4.  **Counter-Play Strategy**: Recognizing his opponent was playing Burgundians (who gain gold from relics), the player immediately shifted to controlling relics in the Castle Age, a brilliant move that targeted the core of his opponent's civilization bonus.
5.  **Punishing Minor Mistakes**: The opponent's seemingly natural mistake of returning villagers to a previously attacked resource patch was ruthlessly punished and turned into a game-winning advantage.

## Notable Moments
- **The Nasty Berry Bush Win**: Killing villagers at the opponent's "nasty berry patch" with Men-at-Arms, which the player identifies as the turning point of the game.
- **The "Trick in the Book"**: Faking a retreat with his scouts only to swing back and snipe a villager, showcasing excellent micro-management.
- **The Double Monastery Decision**: The strategic call to build two monasteries to "control the relics," completely shutting down the Burgundian player's strength.
- **The Player's Conclusion**: "But I want to say this new meta is nasty right now."
