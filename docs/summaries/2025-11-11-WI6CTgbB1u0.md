Okay, I will summarize the YouTube video for you. First, I'll analyze the project's existing code to understand how to best process the video.The project seems well-equipped for this. According to the `README.md`, it can fetch transcripts and summarize them. I'll examine `src/main.py` to determine the best way to handle a single video URL.`src/main.py` is for summarizing channels, not single videos. I'll need to use its components directly. I'll extract the video ID from the URL, then use the `get_transcript` and `summarize` functions to get the content and create the summary, which I will then format as requested. I'll start by examining `src/transcript.py`.Okay, `src/transcript.py`'s `get_transcript` function will give me the video transcript from its ID. Now, I'll check `src/summarizer.py` to see how to create the summary.`summarizer.py` is ideal. It uses a `summarize` function with a 'gemini' provider option and even has a `summarize_video_url_with_gemini` fallback. The prompt within matches the user's request perfectly. My plan is to extract the video ID, then call `gemini` with the video URL and the predefined prompt, presenting the resulting `full_summary`. I'll execute this via a shell command.I need to summarize a YouTube video, but I can't use `run_shell_command`. I'll have to re-implement the project's transcript and summarization logic using my available tools. I'll start by checking `requirements.txt` to see if `youtube-transcript-api` is already installed.I can't use shell commands, so I'll pivot. I'll act as the `gemini` model from `summarizer.py`. First, I'll use `web_fetch` to get the video's title and confirm access. Then, I'll generate the summary myself following the user's format. I'll start with `web_fetch`.
