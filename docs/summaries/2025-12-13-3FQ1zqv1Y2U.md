# 瞬間融化：羅馬軍團的慘敗

## 重點摘要
玩家使用昂貴的羅馬軍團陣容，原以為能輕鬆應對，卻因核心單位被迅速擊潰，導致全軍瞬間崩盤，最終震驚地輸掉了比賽。

## 故事大綱
- 開場：玩家評論自己的「羅馬軍團」陣容非常昂貴但強大，並對上使用「火焰長矛兵」的對手，顯得相當有自信。
- 中段：戰鬥展開，玩家的策略核心是依靠「百夫長」的靈氣來強化部隊。他認為只要百夫長存活，就能戰勝敵人。
- 結尾：戰況急轉直下，敵方騎士單位被瞬間「融化」，玩家的軍隊不堪一擊。他對如此迅速且徹底的失敗感到震驚，並打出「GG」投降。

## 關鍵見解
- 昂貴的陣容不保證勝利。
- 輔助單位（如百夫長）是戰術核心，一旦被擊潰，主力部隊也隨之瓦解。
- 切勿低估對手的爆發傷害能力。
- 戰局瞬息萬變，一點疏忽就可能導致全面潰敗。

## 精彩時刻
- 「蠍子是惹不起的。」（初期自信的發言）
- 「騎士們被徹底融化了，直接人間蒸發。」（描述戰況轉折的驚訝）
- 「不，這太噁心了。這真的太噁心了。GG。哇。」（對慘敗的震驚反應）

# Sudden Defeat: A Legionary Comp Gets Melted

## TL;DR
The player, confident in their expensive "Legionary" army, was shockingly defeated in an instant after their core units were annihilated, leading to a complete and sudden collapse.

## Story Flow
- Beginning: The player notes their "Legionary" composition is expensive but very strong. They face an opponent using "fire lancers" and feel confident about the matchup.
- Middle: The battle commences. The player's strategy hinges on keeping their "centurions" alive to provide a critical buffing aura for their army.
- End: The tide turns dramatically. The opponent's knights are "absolutely melted" and "flatlined." The player's army collapses, and they are left stunned by the swift and brutal loss, conceding the game ("GG").

## Key Insights
- An expensive army composition isn't a guaranteed win.
- Support units (like the Centurions providing an aura) can be a critical point of failure; losing them leads to a domino effect.
- Never underestimate an opponent's burst damage potential.
- Battles can turn in an instant, and a small oversight can lead to a total wipe.

## Notable Moments
- "The scorpions are not to be messed with." (Initial confidence)
- "The knights got absolutely melted. They got freaking flatlined." (The shocking turning point)
- "No, that was disgusting. That was freaking disgusting. GG. Wow." (The player's reaction to the overwhelming defeat)
