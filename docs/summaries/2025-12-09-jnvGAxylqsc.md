# 世紀帝國II：一場混亂但有趣的保加利亞狂暴戰術

## 重點摘要
這是一位《世紀帝國II》玩家使用保加利亞文明，執行一場非主流的「民兵+弓兵+輕裝射手」快攻。雖然開局的攻勢近乎全毀，但他靠著一個關鍵的前線箭塔和之後出奇不意的「城堡（Krepost）快攻」，最終逆轉並贏得了比賽。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：玩家宣布要使用一個複製來的「保加利亞麵條」戰術：民兵、弓兵和輕裝射手的混編部隊，並打算蓋前線軍營。他同時與聊天室互動，歡迎一位從另一位知名實況主（Viper）那裡來的觀眾，並開玩笑說自己比那位實況主更關心粉絲。
- **中段**：他的初期攻勢很快就遇到麻煩，對手的反制讓他損失慘重。他嘗試蓋一座前線箭塔，卻被對方的箭塔反制，僅差一點（98%）就蓋好。在經歷了幾次近乎失敗的挫折後（包括一個即將升級完成的時代進度被打斷在99%），他決定改變策略。
- **結尾**：他冒險地派出大量村民到前線，強行蓋起保加利亞的特色建築「城堡（Krepost）」。這個大膽的舉動成功了，城堡的強大火力讓他一舉壓制了對手，贏得了這場充滿戲劇性的比賽。他將這次的勝利歸功於保加利亞戰術的趣味性和「村民前衝就是強」。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **彈性應對是關鍵**：當最初的戰術失敗時，玩家沒有放棄，而是根據保加利亞的文明優勢（便宜的城堡），迅速轉換到一個更有效的策略。
2.  **高風險高回報**：派遣大量村民到前線蓋城堡是一個極端冒險的行為，一旦失敗就會立刻輸掉比賽。但成功後，回報也極其巨大，直接鎖定勝局。
3.  **心態很重要**：即使在多次瀕臨失敗的窘境下（例如建築物在99%被摧毀），玩家仍保持著娛樂精神，並將其轉化為有趣的內容，這也是他能堅持下去並找到翻盤點的原因。
4.  **與觀眾的互動**：實況主花了不少時間回答觀眾問題，給新手玩家（一位700分的觀眾）提供建議，展現了親民的風格。

## 精彩時刻
- 「一個男人能承受的就這麼多。」（A man can only take so much.） - 在他的時代升級於99%被取消後的絕望吶喊。
- 「村民就是強！」（Villagers are broken.） - 在他用村民成功蓋起前線城堡後，對這個遊戲機制的讚嘆。
- 歡迎從Viper台來的觀眾時，開玩笑說：「那個Viper老兄...他不在乎他的觀眾...在這裡我們回答問題。你今天做了正確的選擇，我的朋友。」
- 整個過程充滿了「差一點就成功」又「差一點就失敗」的緊張時刻，讓這場比賽充滿了娛樂效果。

# Age of Empires II: A Chaotic But Fun Bulgarian Rush Strategy

## TL;DR
An Age of Empires II player attempts an unconventional "militia, archer, and skirmisher" rush with the Bulgarian civilization. Although his initial attack almost completely fails, he manages to turn the game around and win by getting a key forward tower up and executing a surprise Krepost rush.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The player announces he's using a "copy-pasta" Bulgarian strategy involving a mix of militia, archers, and skirms, planning a forward barracks. He interacts with his chat, welcoming a viewer from another famous streamer's (Viper's) channel and joking that he cares more about his viewers.
- **Middle**: His early aggression quickly runs into trouble, and his army is nearly wiped out by the opponent's counter. He attempts to build a forward tower, only to be counter-towered, failing at 98% completion. After several frustrating near-failures (including a feudal age-up getting canceled at 99%), he decides to switch his strategy.
- **End**: He makes a risky all-in move by sending a large group of villagers to the front line to build a Krepost (the unique Bulgarian castle). The bold move pays off; the powerful forward Krepost allows him to overwhelm his opponent and win the dramatic game. He credits the victory to the fun of the Bulgarian strategy and the fact that "villagers forward are broken."

## Key Insights
1.  **Flexibility is Key**: When his initial strategy failed, the player didn't give up. Instead, he pivoted to a more effective strategy based on his civilization's strengths (cheaper Kreposts).
2.  **High-Risk, High-Reward Plays**: Sending a large number of villagers forward is an extremely risky move that could have instantly lost him the game. However, its success also provided a massive, game-winning advantage.
3.  **Mindset Matters**: Even when facing frustrating moments of near-failure (like a building being destroyed at 99%), the player maintained an entertaining and positive attitude, which helped him persevere and find a path to victory.
4.  **Audience Interaction**: The streamer took significant time to answer viewer questions, offering advice to a new player (a 700 ELO viewer) and showcasing an engaging, community-focused style.

## Notable Moments
- "A man can only take so much." - His cry of despair after his age-up was canceled at 99%.
- "Villagers are broken." - His comment of appreciation for the game mechanic after his villagers successfully built the forward Krepost.
- When welcoming the viewer from Viper's stream: "That Viper guy. He doesn't care about his viewers... Here we answer questions. You made the right choice today, my friend."
- The entire match was filled with tense moments of "almost succeeding" and "almost failing," which made it highly entertaining to follow.
