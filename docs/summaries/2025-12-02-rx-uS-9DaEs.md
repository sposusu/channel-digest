# 世紀帝國2：斯堪地那維亞維京對決蒙古

## 重點摘要
這是一場《世紀帝國2》在斯堪地那維亞地圖的示範賽，玩家使用維京對抗蒙古。這場比賽的核心是激烈的湖泊控制權爭奪戰，雙方互相偷蓋碼頭攻擊對方的漁船經濟，最終在玩家成功摧毀對手的漁網後，對手因經濟崩潰而意外投降。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：玩家（Hera）介紹了「斯堪地那維亞」這張地圖的特色：沒有漿果、有大量獵物以及地圖兩側各有一個湖泊。他選擇維京文明，並決定放棄風險較高的「快速城堡」打法，改用裝甲步兵進行早期壓制。
- **中段**：遊戲迅速演變成一場混亂的水陸大戰。玩家偷偷派村民到對手的湖邊蓋碼頭，而對手也做了同樣的事。雙方開始用戰船互相摧毀對方的漁船，同時在陸地上也展開攻防，玩家承受著對手持續的壓力，並設法組織反擊。
- **結尾**：經過一連串的拉鋸後，玩家在水上逐漸佔據優勢。他成功摧毀了對手賴以為生的「漁網」，重創其食物來源。對手在經濟無以為繼的情況下，出乎意料地打出「GG」投降，讓玩家贏得這場充滿變數的比賽。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **水域控制是勝負關鍵**：在這張地圖上，湖泊的漁業經濟至關重要，它既是巨大優勢，一旦失去也是致命弱點。
2.  **偷襲戰術極為有效**：比賽的轉折點在於雙方都試圖在對方後方的湖泊「偷渡」，建立前線海軍基地，這種高風險高回報的策略為遊戲增添了許多變數。
3.  **經濟打擊比軍事更致命**：玩家並非透過一場決定性的會戰取勝，而是透過摧毀對手的食物來源（漁網），導致其經濟崩潰而獲勝。
4.  **地圖特性決定戰術**：斯堪地那維亞鼓勵玩家進行多線操作，必須同時兼顧陸地防守、水上交戰與經濟發展，是張極具挑戰性的地圖。
5.  **早期侵略能有效反制**：玩家開局的步兵騷擾成功干擾了對手的發展節奏，為自己爭取到鞏固防線和策劃下一步行動的時間。

## 精彩時刻
- 雙方隔著地圖，在各自的湖泊上同步狙擊對方的漁船，場面十分混亂有趣。
- 玩家在被圍攻時感嘆：「天啊。這是無情的。來自對手的無情壓力。不過這地圖真好玩。」
- 玩家成功發動一次小型反擊，抓到對手的攻城武器所並將其摧毀。
- 對手在漁網被全數摧毀後，乾脆地打出「GG」投降，讓玩家本人也感到相當驚訝。

# Vikings vs. Mongols on Scandinavia in AoE2

## TL;DR
The player showcases a 1v1 match on the Scandinavia map in Age of Empires II, playing as Vikings against Mongols. The game evolves into a chaotic battle for water control, with both players sneaking docks on each other's lakes, leading to a surprise victory when the opponent resigns after their crucial fishing economy is destroyed.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The player (Hera) introduces the unique features of the Scandinavia map: no berries, abundant hunt, and two lakes on opposite sides. He chooses the Vikings and decides against a risky "fast castle" strategy, opting for early aggression with men-at-arms instead.
- **Middle**: The game quickly escalates into a war on both land and water. The player sneaks a villager to his opponent's lake to build a forward dock, and the opponent does the same in retaliation. Both sides begin sniping each other's fishing ships while also fighting on land, with the player defending against relentless pressure and managing small counter-attacks.
- **End**: After a chaotic back-and-forth, the player gains the upper hand on the water. He successfully destroys his opponent's fish traps, which were their primary food source. Facing economic collapse, the opponent unexpectedly calls "GG" and resigns, securing a surprising win for the player.

## Key Insights
1.  **Water Control is Decisive**: On this map, the fishing economy on the lakes is paramount. It provides a massive advantage but is also a fatal vulnerability if lost.
2.  **Sneak Plays are Highly Effective**: The turning point of the match was both players "sneaking" a villager to the other's lake to build a forward naval base, a high-risk, high-reward strategy that defined the game's flow.
3.  **Economic Damage Can Be More Fatal Than Military Defeat**: The player won not by crushing the opponent's army in a single battle, but by crippling their economy via the destruction of their food supply (fish traps).
4.  **Map Features Dictate Strategy**: Scandinavia encourages multi-front gameplay, forcing players to balance land defense, naval combat, and economic development, making it a very challenging map.
5.  **Early Aggression Can Counter a Greedy Strategy**: The player's initial infantry pressure successfully disrupted the opponent's game plan, buying time to wall up and plan the next move.

## Notable Moments
- The chaotic sequence where both players were simultaneously sniping each other's fishing fleets from across the map.
- The player exclaiming under pressure: "Holy. This is relentless. Relentless pressure from my opponents. Such a fun map though."
- Successfully executing a small counter-attack that caught and destroyed the opponent's siege workshop.
- The opponent's abrupt "GG" right after losing their fish trap economy, which came as a surprise even to the player.
