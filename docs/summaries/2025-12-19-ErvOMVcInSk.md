# Hera評論：為何《世紀帝國》歷久不衰，而其他RTS遊戲卻逐漸式微

## 重點摘要
這部影片是知名《世紀帝國》職業選手 Hera，觀看並評論 YouTuber "RTS Storyteller" 的分析影片。RTS Storyteller 主張《世紀帝國》的成功歸因於其持續的內容更新生態系，以及一個能同時吸引休閒玩家與核心玩家的獨特遊戲循環；Hera 對此表示高度認同，並補充了自己作為職業選手的觀點。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：Hera 介紹他要評論的影片，主題是探討為何《世紀帝國》（AoE）能持續成功，而其他即時戰略遊戲（RTS）卻在衰退。
- **中段**：影片的核心論點分為幾個部分，Hera 逐一評論：
    1.  **強大的生態系**：RTS Storyteller 指出 AoE 像現代手遊一樣，不斷推出新文明、戰役等大量內容，維持遊戲活力。Hera 非常贊同，並強調官方的「路線圖」整合了所有資訊，是一大進步。
    2.  **易懂難精的玩法**：遊戲表面簡單（採集、建造、升級），節奏較慢，對新手友好。Hera 補充說，AoE 的單位（如弓箭手、長矛兵）源自真實歷史，極其直觀，不像《星海爭霸》那樣令新觀眾困惑。
    3.  **高技術深度**：遊戲雖易上手，但四種資源的管理、經濟與軍事的平衡，使其具有極高的技術上限，滿足了核心玩家。Hera 稱讚這是 AoE 的主要優勢，成功地同時服務了休閒玩家（玩戰役、蓋城堡）和職業玩家。
    4.  **獨特的氛圍與藝術**：遊戲帶有城市建造的舒適感，音效和音樂令人放鬆。RTS Storyteller 特別讚揚《世紀帝國2》的 2D 美術是「藝術品」，至今看來仍比 4 代更出色。Hera 對此觀點感到驚喜且完全同意。
- **結尾**：Hera 總結，RTS Storyteller 的分析非常精闢。他認為 AoE 系列正在逆勢成長，而其他 RTS 則在衰退。他很高興看到一個圈外人的觀點，竟與他這位職業選手的想法如此一致，證明了遊戲的普遍魅力。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **成功不只靠懷舊**：AoE 的持續成功並非僅僅依賴懷舊情懷，而是建立在一個活躍的、不斷提供新內容的「遊戲即服務」模式上。
2.  **雅俗共賞是核心**：遊戲最大的優勢在於其「低門檻、高天花板」的設計，讓享受單人內容的休閒玩家和追求極致操作的核心玩家都能找到樂趣。
3.  **直觀性勝過複雜性**：基於歷史的設定讓單位和戰術變得直觀易懂，這使得 AoE 比起科幻或奇幻題材的 RTS 更容易吸引和留住新玩家與觀眾。
4.  **氛圍營造的重要性**：遊戲不只關乎對抗，其「城市建造」般的平靜發展期、悅耳的音效和音樂，提供了一種獨特的「舒適」體驗，這是其他競技性強的 RTS 所缺乏的。
5.  **《世紀帝國2》美術的永恆魅力**：影片和評論者都認為，《世紀帝國2》的 2D 藝術風格精緻且充滿靈魂，其視覺魅力甚至超越了技術更新的續作。

## 精彩時刻
- Hera 生動地比較觀看不同遊戲的感受：「當你看《星海爭霸》時，是外星人剋太空船嗎？誰知道？天曉得那外星人在幹嘛。」
- 關於遊戲同時滿足兩類玩家：「休閒玩家得到了滿足，多人遊戲玩家也以另一種方式得到了滿足，兩邊都極其成功。」
- 聽到 RTS Storyteller 也認為 AoE2 美術優於 AoE4 時，Hera 驚喜地表示：「這太瘋狂了，從一個對 AoE 比較休閒的人口中聽到這點。」
- 影片結尾的玩笑總結：「結論就是，呃，《世紀帝國2》太棒了，然後《世紀帝國4》…很爛。不，開玩笑的，它還行啦。」

# Hera Reacts: Why Age of Empires Still Works When Other RTS Games Don't

## TL;DR
This video features top Age of Empires pro player Hera reacting to a YouTube analysis by "RTS Storyteller." The core argument is that Age of Empires succeeds due to its robust ecosystem of continuous content and a unique gameplay loop that appeals to both casual and hardcore players—an analysis Hera enthusiastically endorses while adding his own professional insights.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: Hera introduces the video he's about to react to, which explores why Age of Empires (AoE) continues to thrive while other Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games are fading.
- **Middle**: The analysis video breaks down AoE's success into several key points, which Hera comments on one by one:
    1.  **A Strong Ecosystem**: RTS Storyteller points out that AoE functions like a modern live-service game, with a constant stream of new content (civs, campaigns) that keeps it fresh. Hera strongly agrees, highlighting the official "roadmap" as a huge improvement for centralizing news and events.
    2.  **Accessible yet Deep Gameplay**: The game is simple on the surface (gather, build, age up) and slower-paced, making it welcoming for new players. Hera adds that AoE's units (archers, spearmen) are intuitive because they're based on real history, unlike the abstract units in a game like *Starcraft* that can confuse new viewers.
    3.  **High Skill Ceiling**: Despite being easy to learn, managing four resources and balancing economy and military gives the game an incredibly high skill ceiling, satisfying competitive players. Hera praises this as AoE's main secret, successfully catering to both casuals (who play campaigns and build bases) and pros.
    4.  **Unique Atmosphere & Art**: The game has a cozy, city-builder feel, with relaxing sounds and music. RTS Storyteller specifically praises AoE2's 2D graphics as a "work of art" that looks better than AoE4 even today. Hera is pleasantly surprised and in full agreement with this take.
- **End**: Hera concludes that RTS Storyteller's analysis is excellent. He believes the AoE franchise is growing against the trend of declining RTS games. He's impressed that an outsider's analysis aligns so perfectly with his own professional perspective, proving the game's universal appeal.

## Key Insights
1.  **Success Beyond Nostalgia**: AoE's endurance isn't just due to nostalgia; it's built on an active, "live-service" model that consistently delivers fresh content.
2.  **The "Casual-Competitive" Sweet Spot**: The game's greatest strength is its "low barrier to entry, high skill ceiling" design, which allows casual, single-player fans and hardcore competitive players to coexist and both feel served.
3.  **Intuitiveness Trumps Complexity**: The historical setting makes units and tactics intuitive and easy to grasp, giving AoE a significant advantage in attracting and retaining new players and viewers compared to abstract sci-fi or fantasy RTS games.
4.  **The Importance of Atmosphere**: The game isn't just about conflict; its calm "city-building" phases and satisfying audio-visual feedback create a uniquely "cozy" experience that other high-stress competitive RTS games lack.
5.  **The Timeless Appeal of AoE2's Art**: Both the original video creator and the professional player agree that Age of Empires 2's 2D art style is so soulful and detailed that its visual appeal has outlasted its more technologically advanced sequels.

## Notable Moments
- Hera's vivid comparison of watchability: "When you watch something like Starcraft, does the alien counter the spaceship? Who knows? God knows what the alien does."
- On serving both player bases: "The casual player is being catered to and the multiplayer players are also being catered to in another way, and both of them extremely successful."
- Hera's surprise upon hearing that RTS Storyteller also prefers AoE2's art over AoE4's: "That's crazy to hear that from someone who might be a bit more casual when it comes to the AoE genre."
- His joking conclusion at the end: "Conclusion, uh, AoE2 is amazing and AoE4, uh, sucks... but no, I'm kidding, it's decent."
