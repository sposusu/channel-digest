# [世紀帝國2：無限資源BUG？葡萄牙「造錢廠」海轟炸塔戰術！](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## 重點摘要
實況主在《世紀帝國2》黑森林地圖上，使用葡萄牙文明執行一項貪婪但極其強大的「快速帝王」轉「貿易工廠 (Feitoria)」戰術。他藉此獲得了源源不絕的無限資源，並轉化為海量的「火砲塔 (Bombard Towers)」進行攻擊，同時將用不完的資源輸送給隊友，最終以壓倒性的經濟和火力輕鬆取勝。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：遊戲開始，實況主在地圖上龜縮，與聊天室閒聊他對魁北克人的印象以及他編輯為他製作的搞笑影片縮圖。他決定採用一個快速升上帝王時代的貪婪開局。
- **中段**：他成功升上時代，並迅速蓋了八座葡萄牙的特殊建築「貿易工廠」，這讓他不需要村民也能持續獲得食物、木材、黃金和石頭。他利用這些「無限資源」，開始在敵方家門口不斷建造火砲塔向前推進，形成一股無法阻擋的壓力。過程中，他還大方地將大量資源「拋(sling)」給隊友，讓隊友的軍隊也變得異常強大。
- **結尾**：在實況主源源不絕的火砲塔和資源充足的隊友的雙重夾擊下，對手找不到任何反擊的方法，只能打出「GG」投降。實況主總結這套戰術非常有趣且近乎無敵。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **葡萄牙貿易工廠的威力**：在像黑森林這樣易守難攻的地圖，貿易工廠能提供近乎無限的後期資源，是個極其強大的經濟引擎。
2.  **從經濟到軍事的轉化**：該策略的核心是將無限的資源轉化為昂貴但高效的攻城單位，如此處的火砲塔，用於不斷的進攻推進。
3.  **終極輔助角色**：擁有無限資源後，玩家可以成為團隊的經濟支柱，透過輸送資源讓隊友的戰力倍增。
4.  **策略的娛樂性**：實況主不斷強調這個策略玩起來「非常有趣」，雖然有點「無賴」，但看著對手被無限的火砲塔淹沒非常有成就感。
5.  **低風險高回報**：一旦貿易工廠蓋起來，玩家的經濟就變得非常安全，不怕被騷擾，可以專注於前線進攻。

## 精彩時刻
- **搞笑縮圖反應**：實況主看到他編輯選了一張他最糟的照片當影片縮圖時，崩潰又好笑地大喊：「我編輯挑了我最醜的照片，老兄這是啥？」
- **命令隊友**：當隊友想在前線蓋城堡時，他立刻阻止：「待在你自己的路，雪諾領主。來吧。蓋前線建築是我的事，老兄，不是你。」然後向隊友索取蓋塔的石頭。
- **戰鬥中討聖物**：在隊友激烈交戰時，他卻在旁邊拜託隊友去幫他撿一個無關緊要的聖物，形成強烈對比。
- **得意忘形**：在策略成功後，他得意地說：「這個策略在某些方面幾乎感覺太強了。我 фактически 擁有無限的火砲塔，而我的隊友有無限的資源。」

# [Age of Empires 2: Infinite Resource BUG? The Portuguese Feitoria Bombard Tower Spam!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## TL;DR
The streamer plays on the Black Forest map in Age of Empires II, executing a greedy but extremely powerful Portuguese "Fast Imperial" into Feitoria strategy. This grants him infinite resources, which he converts into a massive spam of Bombard Towers while also slinging endless resources to his allies, leading to an easy victory through overwhelming economic and military might.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The game starts with the streamer walling up, chatting with his audience about his impressions of Quebec and a funny video thumbnail his editor made. He decides to go for a greedy Fast Imperial Age strategy.
- **Middle**: He successfully reaches the Imperial Age and quickly builds eight Portuguese Feitorias, which generate a continuous flow of food, wood, gold, and stone without villagers. He uses these "infinite resources" to start offensively building Bombard Towers right at the enemy's doorstep, creating relentless pressure. He also generously "slings" huge amounts of resources to his teammates, making their armies incredibly strong as well.
- **End**: Caught between the streamer's endless supply of Bombard Towers and his well-funded teammates, the opponents can find no counter and are forced to call "GG" and surrender. The streamer concludes that the strategy is incredibly fun and feels almost unbeatable.

## Key Insights
1.  **The Power of Portuguese Feitorias**: On closed maps like Black Forest, Feitorias provide a nearly infinite late-game resource income, acting as an extremely powerful economic engine.
2.  **Economy-to-Military Conversion**: The core of the strategy is converting the infinite resource advantage into expensive but effective siege units, like the Bombard Towers used here for a relentless forward push.
3.  **The Ultimate Support Role**: With infinite resources, a player can become the economic backbone of the team, multiplying their allies' strength by slinging them resources.
4.  **Entertainment Value of the Strategy**: The streamer repeatedly emphasizes how "so much fun" the strategy is. Though a bit "obnoxious," he clearly enjoys watching his opponents get overwhelmed by an endless wave of towers.
5.  **Low Risk, High Reward**: Once the Feitorias are established, the player's economy becomes very secure and invulnerable to raids, allowing them to focus entirely on the offensive.

## Notable Moments
- **Thumbnail Reaction**: His hilarious breakdown upon seeing the "goofy ass thumbnail picture" his editor chose: "My editor picked my worst picture, bro. What is this?"
- **Commanding Teammates**: When an ally tries to build a forward castle, he immediately shuts it down: "Stay in your lane, Lord Snow. Come on. The forward buildings is me, brother. That's not you," before asking him for the stone instead.
- **Begging for Relics Mid-Fight**: While his ally is in a heated battle, he's on the side begging him to go pick up an insignificant relic for a tiny gold trickle, creating a hilarious contrast.
- **Gloating in Success**: After the strategy works, he boasts, "This strategy almost feels like overpowered in some ways. I actually have like infinite bombard tower spam and my teammates have infinite res."
