# 世紀帝國II Replay 分析：為何你總是在城堡時代崩盤？

## 重點摘要
玩家自認輸在封建時代的龜縮防守，但分析指出，真正的敗因是在城堡時代過於貪心且決策混亂。他同時開展多項科技與建築，卻未能有效應對敵方的少量散兵，導致經濟和軍事雙雙受創，最終輸掉了本可獲勝的對局。

## 故事大綱
- **開場：** 玩家 Sixophone (越南) 提交了一場他自認因「封建時代龜縮」而輸掉的對戰（對手是欽察）。分析師檢視其開局，認為前期打法穩健，但點出早期建築佈局的瑕疵——未能用建築物保護好主要金礦，為後續的麻煩埋下伏筆。
- **中段：** 遊戲的轉捩點與真正敗因發生在城堡時代。玩家同時蓋了學院、市鎮中心、馬廄和攻城武器所，資源過於分散。面對敵方僅僅十幾隻散兵的騷擾，他未能做出有效反制（例如出+2防禦的騎士或投石車），反而被這支小部隊重創，損失了大量村民和軍隊。
- **結尾：** 儘管中期損失慘重，玩家仍憑藉不錯的營運能力撐到帝王時代。然而，他未能將自己的核心兵種（藤甲弓兵和輕騎兵）集結起來協同作戰，而是分批送上戰場被各個擊破。最後，在仍有大量黃金存量的情況下提早投降，分析師認為戰局尚有可為，真正的問題是從城堡時代就開始的混亂決策。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **問題診斷錯誤：** 玩家自認的敗因（封建龜縮）並非主因。事實上，在封建時代對抗欽察這種強勢文明時，前期的防守反而是正確策略。
2.  **城堡時代的貪婪陷阱：** 同時追求太多目標（升級科技、擴張經濟、開闢多種兵線）會導致資源分散，一事無成。必須分清主次，例如先穩住防守再發展經濟。
3.  **必須有應對常見單位的預案：** 散兵是弓兵文明的頭號剋星。玩家必須有明確的應對方案（如出騎士或投石車），而不是在壓力下慌亂地嘗試所有選項。
4.  **早期佈局影響深遠：** 黑暗時代的建築擺放會直接影響到中後期的資源採集安全與防守效率，一個小失誤可能在20分鐘後演變成大麻煩。
5.  **兵種協同作戰的重要性：** 即使後期擁有了正確的兵種組合（藤甲弓兵+輕騎兵），如果不能讓它們同時投入戰場、互相掩護，也無法發揮戰力，只會被分割消滅。

## 精彩時刻
- 分析師犀利吐槽：「老兄，你竟然輸給10隻散兵？你到底有多少場遊戲是這樣輸掉的？」
- 一個 relatable 的比喻：「你蓋了學院，卻沒去升級（彈道學），這跟我本人一樣，付了大學學費卻沒去上課。」
- 玩家的夢魘：「他試圖清掉一些木牆時，刪掉了自己的第一台投石車，這件事至今仍在他的夢中縈繞不去。」

# AoE2 Replay Review: Why You're Really Losing in Castle Age

## TL;DR
The player believed he lost by turtling in Feudal Age, but the analysis reveals the real loss came from a greedy and chaotic Castle Age. He tried to do too many things at once (boom, tech, multiple production buildings) and failed to create a decisive counter to a small number of enemy skirmishers, leading to a snowballing disadvantage.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning:** The player, Sixophone (Vietnamese vs. Cumans), submits a replay thinking his mistake was playing too defensively in Feudal Age and a misclick deleting a trebuchet. The caster reviews the Dark Age, noting a solid opening but pointing out a critical flaw in building placement that left the main gold vulnerable.
- **Middle:** The turning point was Castle Age. The player simultaneously built a University, a Town Center, a Stable, and a Siege Workshop, spreading his resources too thin. When faced with enemy skirmishers, he had no effective answer—producing a single scout from the stable and scorpions (which are weak vs skirms) instead of mangonels or knights. This allowed a small skirmisher force to deal massive damage.
- **End:** Despite the damage, the player's macro kept him in the game into Imperial Age. However, he failed to coordinate his army composition (Rattan Archers and Light Cavalry), sending them into battle separately where they were defeated piecemeal. He resigned prematurely while still having a large gold bank, in what the caster felt was still a winnable position.

## Key Insights
1.  **Misdiagnosing the Problem:** The player's self-assessed reason for losing (turtling in Feudal) was incorrect; against a strong civilization like the Cumans, a defensive opening is often the right call.
2.  **The Castle Age Greed Trap:** Trying to boom, tech up, and build multiple army production lines all at once leads to being weak everywhere. Prioritization is crucial (e.g., establish defense first, then boom).
3.  **Have a Plan for Common Counters:** Skirmishers are a standard counter to archer civilizations. A player must have a clear, practiced response (like +2 armor knights or mangonels) instead of panicking and trying everything at once.
4.  **Early Game Layout has Lasting Impact:** Building placement in the Dark Age directly affects resource safety and defensive efficiency much later in the game. A small mistake can become a major problem 20 minutes later.
5.  **The Power of Army Coordination:** Having the right unit composition is useless if the units aren't massed and used together to support each other in a fight. Sending them in separately just gets them killed for free.

## Notable Moments
- The caster's blunt feedback: "Bro, you're folding to 10 skirms. How many games on your account did you lose just cuz your opponent made 10 skirms?"
- A relatable analogy: "You make a university and you don't go to it, like me in real life. I paid for university, didn't go."
- The trebuchet that "haunts my dreams": The player's own description of his frustrating mistake of deleting his own trebuchet while trying to clear some walls.
