# 職業選手的奇葩戰術：在1v3中靠砍光所有樹木獲勝

## 重點摘要
職業電競選手 Hera 在一場對三名新手的世紀帝國2比賽中，放棄了快速取勝的機會。他反而給自己設定了一個龐大的「支線任務」：用攻城武器系統性地砍光對手半場的所有樹木，最終徹底摧毀了他們的經濟，迫使他們投降。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：Hera（世界排名前十）在一場 1v3 的亞馬遜隧道地圖中對抗三位新手玩家。他隨機選到新文明「契丹」，並決定採用早期斥侯快攻來控制地圖中心、奪取聖物，以彌補單人無法貿易的黃金劣勢。
- **中段**：在初期騷擾成功後，Hera 覺得直接獲勝太無趣，於是開啟了一個瘋狂的支線任務：砍光對手那半邊地圖的所有樹木。他一邊發展經濟，一邊派出大量「火箭炮」（投石車） methodical地清除森林。遊戲變成了一場競賽：Hera 的「伐木」計畫對抗著三名對手逐漸成形的軍隊。
- **結尾**：對手集結兵力發動猛烈反攻，戰況一度變得緊張。然而，Hera 的「斷木」策略最終奏效，對手因缺乏木材導致經濟完全崩潰，無法補充農田和部隊。Hera 最後在地圖上建起一道巨大的石牆，徹底封鎖了對手，贏得了這場極具娛樂性的比賽。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **木材比黃金更重要**：在遊戲後期，木材是經濟的命脈。沒有木材，就無法建造農田、建築和大多數單位，經濟會完全停擺。
2.  **創新的勝利條件**：勝利不只有軍事征服。透過攻擊對手經濟中最基礎的一環（如此處的木材），可以創造出意想不到的勝利條件。
3.  **享受遊戲的過程**：與其單純地碾壓對手，Hera 選擇了一個有趣且充滿挑戰的「支線任務」，不僅讓自己獲得樂趣，也為觀眾創造了一場難忘的對局。
4.  **地圖控制的極致**：Hera 透過不斷騷擾和建造前哨站，牢牢控制了地圖視野，確保他的伐木計畫能順利執行而不被輕易發現。
5.  **心理戰的威力**：當對手發現自己的森林逐漸消失時，那種無力感和恐慌遠比一次正面會戰的打擊更大。

## 精彩時刻
- **鮑伯·魯斯時刻**：Hera 將自己用投石車大規模砍樹的過程，形容成一集輕鬆療癒的「鮑伯·魯斯（Bob Ross）繪畫教學」。
- **邪惡的宣言**：當他透過前哨站觀察對手找不到木材的窘境時，他幸災樂禍地說：「折磨人的重點就是要聽到他們的哀嚎，不然有什麼意義？」
- **尷尬的友軍傷害**：在他剛嘲諷完「有些職業選手」會誤傷自己的單位後，他立刻就用自己的投石車砸死了自己的部隊。
- **萬里長城**：遊戲尾聲，他在地圖中央建造了一道橫跨兩端的巨大石牆，徹底斷絕对手机會，並戲稱自己剛從中國回來，看過萬里長城。
- **對手的陷阱卡**：一名對手在聊天中打出「他中了我的陷阱卡！」，Hera 則一頭霧水地在畫面上尋找根本不存在的陷阱。

# Pro Player's Bizarre Strategy: Winning a 1v3 by Deleting All the Wood

## TL;DR
In a 1v3 match against beginners, pro player Hera forgoes a quick victory. Instead, he undertakes a massive "side quest" to systematically chop down all the wood on his opponents' side of the map, ultimately crippling their economy and forcing them to surrender.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: Hera (a top 10 player) faces three beginner players on the Amazon Tunnel map in a 1v3. He gets the Khitans, a new civilization, and decides on an early scout rush to control the map center and secure relics, compensating for his inability to trade for gold.
- **Middle**: After a successful initial rush, Hera decides a straightforward win would be boring and embarks on a crazy side quest: to cut down every single tree on his opponents' half of the map. While booming his economy, he sends out waves of "rocket carts" (Onagers) to methodically clear the forests. The game becomes a race between Hera's bizarre wood-denial project and his opponents' attempts to build an army.
- **End**: The game gets intense as the opponents mount a major counter-attack. However, Hera's "wood control" strategy proves devastatingly effective. With no wood, the opponents' economies completely collapse, leaving them unable to reseed farms or produce units. Hera seals their fate by building a giant stone wall across the map, winning the highly entertaining game.

## Key Insights
1.  **Wood is More Critical Than Gold**: In the late game, wood is the lifeblood of the economy. Without it, you can't build farms, buildings, or most units, bringing the economy to a complete halt.
2.  **Creative Win Conditions**: Victory isn't just about military conquest. By attacking the most fundamental part of an opponent's economy (in this case, wood), you can create an unexpected path to victory.
3.  **Enjoying the Process**: Instead of simply stomping his opponents, Hera chose a fun and challenging "side quest" that not only entertained himself but also created a memorable game for the viewers.
4.  **The Ultimate Map Control**: Through constant harassment and building outposts, Hera maintained total map vision, ensuring his wood-cutting plan could be executed without being easily discovered.
5.  **The Power of Psychological Warfare**: The feeling of helplessness and panic an opponent experiences while watching their forests disappear is far more impactful than a single lost battle.

## Notable Moments
- **The Bob Ross Moment**: Hera described his process of mass-deforestation with Onagers as a relaxing and therapeutic "Bob Ross episode."
- **A Villainous Declaration**: As he watched his opponents struggle to find wood via his outposts, he gleefully said, "What's the point of torturing someone if I'm not going to hear them cry out for pain?"
- **Ironic Friendly Fire**: Immediately after mocking "some pros" for killing their own units with friendly fire, he proceeds to do the exact same thing with his own Onagers.
- **The Great Wall**: In the endgame, he builds a massive stone wall spanning the entire map to seal off his wood-starved opponents, joking that he just got back from seeing the Great Wall of China.
- **The Opponent's Trap Card**: One opponent types in chat, "He fell for my trap card," leaving Hera hilariously searching the screen for a non-existent trap.
