# 2025年度棒球大事件票選回顧

## 重點摘要
這是一場由直播主舉辦的年度線上票選活動，旨在與觀眾共同選出2025年每個月的代表性棒球大事件。最終，在所有月份冠軍的對決中，「世界大賽G7 三本由伸中繼2.2局無失分奪勝投」被票選為年度總冠軍。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：直播主宣布第二屆「逐月棒球大事件票選」開始，並回顧了去年的結果。他強調，事件是否與棒球相關的標準「由我決定」，接著從一月開始，讓觀眾針對候選事件進行即時投票。
- **中段**：直播逐月進行，涵蓋了從一月到十二月的重大事件。內容五花八門，包含球員簽約（李珠恩、成晉）、WBC經典賽、球員生涯里程碑（鄭宗哲、林智勝）、球隊爭議（樂天伙食問題、臭壽司事件）、戲劇性比賽、以及引發熱議的「成晉開球事件」。投票過程充滿了即時互動和無法預測的結果，其中六月的票選甚至出現了50/50的平手僵局。在進行十二月投票時，直播現場意外遭遇了一場明顯的地震，引起主持人和聊天室的即時反應。
- **結尾**：在選出所有月份的冠軍後，舉行了最終決選，從中選出年度大事件。最終，「世界大賽G7 三本由伸宰制級表現」以壓倒性票數獲勝，為整場票選活動劃下句點。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **「棒球事件」的定義極其寬鬆**：從球員合約、退休、場上表現，到球場伙食、球迷標價開球權等場外花絮，都成為票選主題，反映了棒球文化的多元與趣味性。
2.  **國際賽事與旅外球員關注度高**：儘管中職事件佔多數，但旅美球員登上大聯盟（鄭宗哲、鄧愷威）以及日本球星在世界大賽的表現（大谷翔平、三本由伸），往往能獲得更高的關注與票數。
3.  **社群輿論與球迷情感是投票主導力量**：許多事件的勝出，源於其戲劇性或情感價值，例如林智勝生涯最終打席的全壘打，或是引發廣泛同情的毛銀盛因故退出明星賽。
4.  **爭議性話題引發激烈討論**：樂天桃猿隊的伙食風波和宿舍環境問題多次被提名，成為橫跨整年度的笑料與話題。而「成晉開球事件」及其相關的球迷鬥內標案，則凸顯了當年度最具爭議性的時刻。
5.  **直播的即時性創造獨特體驗**：觀眾的投票直接決定了敘事走向，而直播中途發生的地震，更成為一個無法預期的插曲，展現了直播互動的真實與臨場感。

## 精彩時刻
- **樂天伙食宇宙**：從四月的「熱炒店」伙食問題，到八月的「臭壽司」事件，再到十一月的地獄級宿舍，樂天的後勤問題貫穿全年，成為不斷被提起的笑點。
- **六月開球權之亂**：直播主將「成晉開球事件」與「球迷花17萬標下開球資格」兩件事分開投票，結果竟出現50/50的完美平手。主持人最後決定讓兩件事「合寫」並列為六月冠軍。
- **大師兄的完美句點**：九月，「林智勝生涯最後打席擊出第305轟」以壓倒性的82%得票率獲勝，其無可取代的戲劇性與傳奇色彩，讓其他事件相形失色。
- **直播中突遇地震**：在進行十二月投票時，一場有感地震來襲，直播主與聊天室觀眾即時分享搖晃的感受，從驚訝到確認震央位置，過程完全放送。
- **最終冠軍的誕生**：在最終決選中，日本投手三本由伸在世界大賽G7的精彩表現，擊敗了中職整年度的所有話題事件，被票選為「2025年度棒球大事件」。

# 2025 Baseball Event of the Year Poll Recap

## TL;DR
This video is a live stream where the host runs an annual online poll with his audience to select the most significant baseball event for each month of 2025. In the final vote among all monthly winners, "Yoshinobu Yamamoto's 2.2 scoreless relief innings to earn the win in World Series Game 7" was crowned the event of the year.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The host kicks off the second annual "Monthly Baseball Event Poll," recapping the previous year's winner. He humorously states that the criteria for what counts as a "baseball event" are "decided by me" and begins the live voting process, starting with January.
- **Middle**: The stream progresses month by month, covering major events from January to December. The candidates are diverse, including player signings (Lee Ju-eun, Cheng Chin), the WBC, career milestones (Cheng Tsung-che, Lin Chih-sheng), team controversies (Rakuten's food issues, rotten sushi incident), dramatic games, and the highly debated "Cheng Chin opening pitch incident." The voting is filled with real-time interaction and unpredictable results, including a 50/50 tie in June. While polling for December, a noticeable earthquake occurs, and the host and chat react to it live.
- **End**: After crowning a winner for each month, a final poll is held to determine the overall "Event of the Year." "Yoshinobu Yamamoto's dominant World Series performance" wins by a landslide, concluding the event.

## Key Insights
1.  **The Definition of "Baseball Event" is Extremely Broad**: The poll included everything from contracts and retirements to on-field performance, stadium food quality, and fan-funded opening pitches, reflecting the diverse and often humorous nature of baseball culture.
2.  **International Games and Players Abroad Garner High Interest**: While CPBL events were numerous, Taiwanese players making it to the MLB (Cheng Tsung-che, Teng Kai-wei) and the performance of Japanese stars in the World Series (Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto) often attracted more attention and votes.
3.  **Community Opinion and Emotion Drive Voting**: The success of many events was tied to their narrative drama or emotional weight, such as Lin Chih-sheng's home run in his final career at-bat or Mo Yin-sheng's withdrawal from the All-Star Game, which drew widespread sympathy.
4.  **Controversial Topics Spark Intense Debate**: The Rakuten Monkeys' recurring food and lodging issues were nominated multiple times, becoming a running gag throughout the year. The "Cheng Chin opening pitch incident" and a related fan auction highlighted one of the year's most contentious moments.
5.  **The Live Format Creates a Unique Experience**: Viewer votes directly shaped the narrative, while unexpected moments like the live earthquake became an unforgettable part of the broadcast, showcasing the authenticity and immediacy of live streaming.

## Notable Moments
- **The Rakuten Food Universe**: From the "stir-fry joint" food quality issue in April to the "rotten sushi" incident in August and the "hellish dorms" in November, Rakuten's logistical problems were a recurring punchline.
- **June's Opening Pitch Chaos**: The host separated the "Cheng Chin opening pitch incident" and a fan paying NT$170,000 for an opening pitch into two poll options. The vote resulted in a perfect 50/50 tie, leading the host to declare them joint winners.
- **Lin Chih-sheng's Perfect Farewell**: In September, "Lin Chih-sheng hitting his 305th HR in his final career at-bat" won with an overwhelming 82% of the vote, its legendary status and perfect drama eclipsing all other events.
- **Earthquake on Air**: During the December vote, a tangible earthquake struck. The host and his live chat shared their real-time reactions, from surprise to confirming the epicenter's location, all on camera.
- **Crowning the Ultimate Champion**: In the final showdown, Japanese pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's stellar World Series Game 7 performance defeated all the major domestic CPBL stories of the year to be named the "2025 Baseball Event of the Year."
