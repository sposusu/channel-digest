# 談小哥事件：一個棒球YouTuber的版權辛酸史

## 重點摘要
一名資深棒球YouTuber「駕馭」，在看見盜用MLB畫面的「小哥」頻道被抄後，感到「心理平衡」。他藉此分享自己多年來遵守版權規定卻步履維艱的辛酸，並坦言曾因盜版者輕鬆獲取暴利而價值觀崩潰。他認為，只要懲罰僅止於下架頻道，巨大的利益仍會驅使盜版者不斷另起爐灶。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：影片開頭，駕馭談論知名棒球頻道「小哥的棒球夾克」因版權問題被永久關播。他澄清，動手的不是MLB官方，而是台灣轉播總代理「愛爾達」。他以此為契機，分享自己作為台灣最早遇到版權問題的棒球YouTuber的親身經歷。

- **中段**：駕馭回憶，他在2018年因使用網路照片被MLB官方警告，從此改變風格，不再使用未授權素材。他詳述了個人創作者向MLB購買影音授權的極度困難（幾乎不可能），這也導致他後來轉向購買中華職棒的版權來製作內容。他對比自己守規矩的辛苦，與小哥頻道靠盜用畫面輕鬆獲取巨額流量和收入（他粗估可能超過兩千萬台幣），並坦承，這種不公平感曾讓他陷入價值觀崩壞，開始懷疑「自己堅持的到底對不對」。

- **結尾**：愛爾達的這次行動，讓他感到「心理稍微平衡一點」，證明了堅持原則並非錯誤。但他發現小哥似乎只是換了頻道繼續上傳，並預測對方未來會轉向盜用更難被追查的國外體育節目。他總結，只要沒有法律追償，盜版背後的龐大利益會讓這種行為不斷發生，而他將以觀察者的角度，繼續看事件如何發展。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **版權執法的不對等**：遵守版權的創作者在流量競爭上處於絕對劣勢，而不遵守者能輕易獲取巨大流量與利益，形成劣幣驅逐良幣的困境。
2.  **官方授權管道的缺失**：對於個人創作者而言，即使願意付費，也幾乎沒有管道能向MLB等大型機構購買正規的影音授權，阻礙了優質內容的產出。
3.  **懲罰力道不足**：僅下架頻道無法有效嚇阻盜版。盜版者鉅額獲利早已入口袋，若無法律追償，他們只會另起爐灶，犯罪成本極低。
4.  **盜版策略的演化**：為規避查緝，盜版者會不斷進化，轉向翻譯國外談話節目等更難被原始版權方發現的灰色地帶內容，增加追查難度。
5.  **默許的環境**：在版權方採取行動前，大量觀眾並不在意內容來源，這種「觀眾愛看、官方沒抓」的環境，讓盜版者得以長期存在並坐大。

## 精彩時刻
- **價值觀崩壞的自白**：「我甚至開始懷疑自己了...會不會其實錯的是我們啊？...我開始覺得自己的心態好糟糕哦，因為他做的東西，就一堆人喜歡，版權方也沒講話，那我為什麼還要一直覺得他是用這種侵權的東西？」
- **驚人的收入估算**：他以極度保守的方式估算，小哥頻道僅YouTube長影片的收入就可能高達2000多萬台幣，揭示了盜版背後龐大的經濟誘因。
- **看見盜版頻道被抓的真實感受**：「看的是蠻開心的啊...也不是看到他頻道終於被處理掉了好爽...只會覺得，心理稍微平衡一點啊。」
- **對盜版者下一步的預測**：「他接下來放的影片...就不要有愛爾達有版權的東西...（改放）國外的棒球相關節目...他們（美國節目方）有可能找到台灣這邊嗎？我覺得機會非常小。」

# On the 'Xiao Ge' Incident: A Baseball YouTuber's Copyright Struggles

## TL;DR
A veteran baseball YouTuber, "Jiàyù," feels a sense of "psychological balance" after a major pirating channel, "Xiao Ge," was shut down. He shares his own difficult journey of adhering to copyright rules for years, admitting he once had a crisis of values watching pirates easily make huge profits. He concludes that as long as the penalty is merely a channel takedown, the massive financial incentives will drive pirates to simply start over.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The video starts with Jiàyù discussing the permanent shutdown of the popular baseball channel "Xiao Ge's Baseball Jacket" over copyright issues. He clarifies that the action was taken not by MLB itself, but by its official Taiwanese broadcast partner, ELTA. He uses this event as a jumping-off point to share his own personal history as one of the first Taiwanese baseball YouTubers to face copyright problems.

- **Middle**: Jiàyù recalls being warned by MLB in 2018 for using photos found online, which forced him to change his style and stop using unauthorized materials. He details the extreme difficulty for an individual creator to legitimately license video clips from MLB (it's nearly impossible), which led him to pivot to covering the Taiwanese league (CPBL) after successfully purchasing their video rights. He contrasts his own difficult, rule-abiding path with Xiao Ge's channel, which easily gained massive views and revenue (he roughly estimates over NT$20 million) by using pirated clips. He confesses this unfairness caused him to have a crisis of values, making him wonder if he was the one in the wrong for following the rules.

- **End**: ELTA's action brought him a sense of "psychological balance," validating that his principles weren't misguided. However, he observes that Xiao Ge is reportedly just re-uploading on new channels and predicts they will now pivot to pirating harder-to-trace content like foreign sports talk shows. He concludes that without legal and financial repercussions, the huge profits will ensure this behavior continues, and he will remain an observer to see how the situation unfolds.

## Key Insights
1.  **Asymmetric Copyright Enforcement**: Creators who respect copyright are at a significant disadvantage in the competition for views, creating a situation where rule-breakers can easily thrive.
2.  **Lack of Official Licensing Channels**: For individual creators, there are virtually no established channels to purchase video rights from major organizations like MLB, even if they are willing to pay. This stifles the creation of high-quality, legitimate content.
3.  **Insufficient Penalties**: Simply taking down a channel is an ineffective deterrent. Pirates have already pocketed enormous profits, and without legal action to reclaim earnings, the risk is negligible, and they will just start a new channel.
4.  **The Evolution of Piracy Tactics**: To evade detection, pirates will evolve, shifting to gray-area content like translating foreign talk shows, which is much harder for the original copyright holders to discover and police.
5.  **A Permissive Environment**: Before a rights holder takes action, the combination of a large audience that doesn't care about the content's source and official inaction allows piracy to exist and grow for a long time.

## Notable Moments
- **Confession of a Value Crisis**: "I even started to doubt myself... could it be that we were the ones who were wrong? ... I started to feel my mentality was terrible. Because so many people liked what he was doing, and the copyright holder said nothing, so why did I keep thinking he was using infringing content?"
- **The Staggering Revenue Estimate**: His extremely conservative calculation estimates the pirate channel's YouTube revenue alone could be over NT$20 million (~$650k USD), revealing the massive financial motive behind piracy.
- **His Honest Reaction to the Takedown**: "I was quite happy to see it... not in a 'Haha, you finally got what you deserved' way... but more of a feeling of psychological balance."
- **Predicting the Pirate's Next Move**: "The videos he posts next... just won't have things ELTA has rights to... [he'll use] foreign baseball talk shows... Is it possible for them [the US producers] to find him over here in Taiwan? I think the chances are very small."
