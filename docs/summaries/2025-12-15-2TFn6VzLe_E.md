# 世紀帝國2：高手2v4逆境求生戰

## 重點摘要
一名頂尖玩家與隊友聯手，在一場2對4的《世紀帝國2》比賽中挑戰看似不可能的劣勢。他們藉由斯拉夫文明強大的經濟加成、關鍵的兵種轉換，以及後期瘋狂建造城堡的戰術，最終成功壓制四名對手，贏得了一場史詩級的逆轉勝。

## 故事大綱
- **開場**：高手玩家 Harris (使用斯拉夫) 與一名中階隊友，對抗四名實力相當的玩家。Harris 的策略是利用斯拉夫的農田加成來建立強大經濟，早期用斥候騷擾，為後期做準備。
- **中段**：Harris 在前期成功壓制一名對手 (紫色)，並在城堡時代轉出騎士。然而，敵方四人集結大軍對他發動毀滅性猛攻，Harris 靠著精湛的微操與僧侶防守驚險擋下。隨後，他轉型為斯拉夫獨特的「貴族鐵騎」(Boyar)，並在地圖上大量建造城堡，開始掌握地圖控制權。
- **結尾**：憑藉著貴族鐵騎的強大戰力與遍佈地圖的18座城堡，Harris 與隊友徹底封鎖了敵人的資源與行動。他們建立了穩固的貿易路線，並加入冠軍劍士，最終以絕對的經濟和軍事優勢，逐一擊潰四名對手，贏得了這場長達一小時多的艱苦戰役。

## 關鍵見解
1.  **文明選擇是關鍵**：在寡擊眾的局面下，選擇斯拉夫是致勝關鍵。其農田加成提供了強大的經濟續航力，讓玩家能持續產兵對抗多名敵人。
2.  **兵種轉換的藝術**：從騎士轉型為貴族鐵騎是比賽的轉捩點。貴族鐵騎能有效對抗敵方的騎士海，是斯拉夫後期最核心的戰力。
3.  **城堡是最好的防禦與進攻**：Harris 在後期建造了18座城堡，不僅鞏固了防線，更一步步壓縮敵人的生存空間，成為壓垮對手的最後一根稻草。
4.  **劣勢下的積極心態**：即使面對2v4的巨大壓力，Harris 始終保持主動，不斷騷擾、進攻，迫使對手疲於奔命，無法發揮人數優勢。
5.  **經濟基礎決定上層建築**：穩固的經濟（來自農田加成與三座遺跡）讓 Harris 能在後期支撐昂貴的兵種與大量的城堡，是逆轉的根本。

## 精彩時刻
- **早期騷擾**：開局就成功壓制紫色玩家，讓他幾乎崩盤，為團隊爭取了寶貴的時間。
- **驚險防守**：在城堡時代中期，面對四人聯軍的致命一擊，Harris 在基地驚險守住，展現了頂尖玩家的抗壓性與操作。
- **「再見啦，老闆！」**：在一次突襲後，Harris 的騎士單位帥氣地擺脫追擊，他在旁白中興奮地喊出：「Freaking see you, boss!」。
- **18座城堡的奇觀**：遊戲結束時數據顯示 Harris 建造了18座城堡，完全控制了地圖，讓對手絕望。
- **未來的賽事計畫**：影片中途，Harris 宣布他計畫在2026年舉辦一系列高獎金的《世紀帝國2》戰隊表演賽，希望能振興團隊競賽的熱度。

# Age of Empires 2: An Expert's 2v4 Survival Gauntlet

## TL;DR
A top-tier player and his teammate defy the odds in a 2-vs-4 Age of Empires II match. Leveraging the Slavs' powerful economic bonus, making a critical unit switch, and executing a late-game strategy of mass-producing castles, they successfully overwhelm four opponents to claim an epic comeback victory.

## Story Flow
- **Beginning**: The expert player, Harris (playing as Slavs), teams up with a mid-level ally against four players of comparable skill. Harris's strategy is to use the Slav farming bonus to build a powerhouse economy, using early scout cavalry to harass and buy time for the late game.
- **Middle**: Harris successfully suppresses one opponent (Purple) in the early game and transitions to Knights in the Castle Age. However, the enemy team launches a massive, coordinated attack on his base. Harris narrowly defends with exceptional micro-management and monks. This becomes the turning point where he switches to the unique Slav unit, the Boyar, and begins taking over the map by building numerous castles.
- **End**: With the sheer power of Boyars and a staggering 18 castles spread across the map, Harris and his teammate completely choke the enemy's resources and movement. They establish a secure trade route, add Champions to their army, and ultimately crush the four opponents with overwhelming economic and military superiority, winning the grueling hour-plus game.

## Key Insights
1.  **Civilization Choice is Crucial**: Picking Slavs was key to winning while outnumbered. Their farming bonus provides immense economic stamina, allowing for continuous unit production against multiple foes.
2.  **The Art of the Unit Switch**: The transition from Knights to Boyars was the game's pivotal moment. Boyars effectively counter enemy cavalry hordes and are the core of the Slavs' late-game power.
3.  **Castles are the Best Offense and Defense**: Harris built 18 castles in the late game, which not only fortified his position but also systematically squeezed the opponents out of the map, becoming the final straw that broke them.
4.  **Proactive Mindset Under Pressure**: Despite the immense pressure of a 2v4, Harris stayed on the offensive, constantly harassing and attacking to keep the opponents reactive and unable to leverage their numbers advantage.
5.  **Economy is Everything**: A solid economic foundation (from the farming bonus and three captured relics) allowed Harris to afford expensive units and mass castles in the late game, which was the fundamental reason for the comeback.

## Notable Moments
-   **Early Game Harassment**: He successfully crippled the Purple player right from the start, buying invaluable time for his team.
-   **The Close-Call Defense**: In the mid-Castle Age, he miraculously held off a potentially game-ending push from all four opponents, showcasing a top player's resilience and skill.
-   **"Freaking see you, boss!"**: After a successful raid, Harris's knights made a clean escape, prompting him to excitedly narrate, "Freaking see you, boss!"
-   **The Spectacle of 18 Castles**: The post-game stats revealed Harris had built 18 castles, creating a fortress network that gave the opponents no hope.
-   **Future Tournament Plans**: Mid-video, Harris announces his plan to organize a series of high-prize-pool AoE2 team show matches in 2026 to revive the team game scene.
